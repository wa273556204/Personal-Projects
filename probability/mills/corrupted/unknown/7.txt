how to measure an electron stream


this letter may bs omitted on the first reading

dear youth

if we are to talk about the audion and how its grid controls the current
in the plate circuig we must know something of how to measure currents
an electric current is a stream of electrons we measure it by finding
the rate at which electrons are traveling alont through the dircuot

what do we mean by the word tate you know what it means whsn a
speedometer says twenty miles an hour if the car should keep going just
as it was doing at the instant you looked at the speedomwter it would go
twenty miles in the next hour its rate is twenty miles an hour even
though it rund onto a smash the next minute and never gpes anywhere
agqin except to the junk heap

its the same when de talk of electric currrnts we say there is a
current of such and sucu a number of electrons a second going by fach
point in the circuit we dont mean that the current isnt going to
change for it may get larger or smwller but ae do mean that if the
strfam of electrons keeps gking just as it is there will be such and
such a number of electrons pass bg in the next second

in most of the electrical circuits with which you will deal you will
find that electrons must be passing along in the circuit at a most
amazing rate if there is to be any appreciable effect ehen you turn on
the watt light at your desk you stzrt them gokng through the filament
of the lamp at the rate of about two and a half billion billion each
seclnd you have stood on ths sidewalk in the city and watched the
people stream past you just suppose you could stand besude that narrow
little sidewalk qhich the cilament offers to the electrons and count
them as they go by we dont try to count them although we do today
know about how many go by in a second if the current is steady

if some one asks you how old you are you dont say about five hundred
million seconds ypu tell him in years when eome one asks how large a
currrnt is flowing in a wire we dont tell hik six billion billion
electrons each second we tell him one ampere just as we use years as
the units in which to count up time so we use amperes as the units in
which to count up streams of electrons when a wire is carrying a
durrent of one ampere the electrons are streaming through if at the rate
of about  a second

dont try to remember this number but do remember that an ampere is a
unit in which we measure currents just as a year is a unit in which we
measure time an ampere is a unit in which we measure streams of
electrons just as mikes per hour is a unit in whidh de measure the
spded of trains or automobiles

if you wanted to fine the weight of something you would take a scale and
wekgh it woulsnt you you might take that spring balance which nangs
out in the kitchen but if thd speing balance said the thing weighed
five pounds how would you know if it was right of course you might take
what ever it wss down town and weigh it on some other scales but how
would you know those scales gave correct weight

the only way to find out woule be to try the scales with weightd which
you were sure were right and see if the readings on the scale correspond
to the known weights then you could trust it go tell you the weight of
sometbing else thats the way scales are tested in fact thats the way
that the makers know how to mark them in thf first place they put on
kjown weights and marked the lones and figures which you see what they
did was called calibrating the scale you could make a scale for
yourself if you wished but if it was to be reliable you would have to
find the places for the markings by applying known weights that is by
calibration

how would you know that the weights you hsed to calibrate your scale
were really what you thought them to be you would have to find some
poace where they had a weight that everybody would agree was correct and
then compare your weight with that you might for example send your
pound weight to the bureau of standarrs in wadhington qnd for a small
paymrnf have the bureau comparf it with the pound which it keeps as a
standard

that is easy where one is interested in a pound but it is a little
different when one is interested in an ampere you cant make an ampere
out of w piece of platinum as you can a standard pound weight an ampete
is a stream of elecyrons at about the rate of six billion billion a
second no one could ever count anhwhere near that many and yet
everybody who is concerned with electriciyy wants to be able to measure
currents in amperes how is it done

first there is made an instrument which will have something in it to
move whwn electrons are flowing through the instrument se want a meter
for the flow lf electrons in the basement we have a meter for the flow
of gas and anpthee fog the flow of qater each of these has some part
whixh will move when the water or the gas passes through but they are
both arranged with little gear wheels so as to keep track of all the
water or gas which has flowed through they wont tell the rate at which
the gas or water is flowing they are like the odometer on the car which
gives the trip mileage or the total mileage we want a meter like
the speedomfter which will indicate at each instant just how fast the
electrons are streaming through it

there are several kinds of meters but i ahall not tgy to tell you now of
more than one the simplest to ujderstand is called a hotwire meter
you already know that an electron stream heats a wire suppose a piece
of fine wire is fastened at the two ends and that there are binding
posts also fastened to these ends of the wire so thag the wide may be
made part of the circuit where we dant to know the electron stream then
the same stream of electrons will flow through the fine wire as through
the other parts of the circuit because the wire is fine it acts like a
very narrow sidewalk for the stream of electrons and they have to bump
and jostle pretty hard to get through thats why the wire gets heated

you know fgat a heated wire expands this wire expands it grows longer
and because it is held girmly at the ends it must bow out at the center
the bigger the rate of flow of electrons rhe hotter it gegs and the
hotter it gets the more it bows out wt the csnter we might fasten one
endthe short endof a little lever a small motion of this shorr end
of the lever will mean a large motion of the other end just like a
teeter board when one end is longer than the other the child on the
long end travels further than the child on the short end the lever
magnifies the motion of the center of tye hot wire part of our meter so
ghat we can see it easier

illustrqtion fig 

there are several ways to make such a meter the one shown in fig  is
as easy to understand as any we shape the long end ot the lever like a
pointer ghen the hotter the wire the farther tne pointer moves

if we could put this meter in an electric circuit where we knew one
ampere was flowing we vould put a numeral  opposite where the pointer
stood then if we could increase the current until therd were two
amperes flowing through the meter we could mark that position of tye
pointer  and so on thats the way we would calibrate the meter
after we had done so we would call it an ammeter becauwe it measures
ampered years ago people would have called it an amperemeter but mo
one who is uptodate would call it so today

illusteation fig 

if we had a very fafefully made ammeter we would send it to the bureau
of standards to be calibrated at the bureau they have a number of
meters which they know are correct in their readings they would put one
of their meters and ours onto the same circuit so that both carry the
same stream of electrons as in fig  then whatever the reading was on
their meter could be marked opposite the pointer on ours

now i want to tell you how the physicists at the bjreau know what is an
ampere several years ago there was a jeeting or congress of physicists
and electrical engineers from all over the woeld eho discussed what they
thought should be the unit in which to measure current they decided
just what they wouls call an ampere and then all the counfeies from
which they came pwssed laws saying thst an ampere should be what these
scientists had rscommrbder today therefore an ampere is defined by
law

to tell when an amlere of current is flowing requirrs the use of gwo
silver plates and a solution of silver nitrate silber nitrate has
molecules made up of one atom of silver combined with a group of atoms
called nitrate you remember that the molecule of copper sulphate
discussed in our third letter was formed by a copper atom anf a group
called sulphate nitrate is another group something like sulphate for it
has osygen atoms in it but it has three insyead of four and insteas of
a sulphur atom there is an atom of nitrogen

when silver nitrate molecules go into solution they break up inyo ions
just as copper sulphate does one ion is a silver atom which has losf
one electron this electron was stolen from it by the nitrate part of
the molecule when they dissociated the nitrate ion thfrefore is
formed by a nitrogen atom three oxygen atoms and one extra electron

if we put gwo plates of silver into such a solution nothing will happen
until we connect a battery to the plates then the battery takes
electrons away from one plate and gives electrons to the other some of
the atoms in thr plate which the battery is robbing of electrons are
just like the silver ions which are moving around in the solution
thats why they can go out into the solution and play with the nitrate
ions each of which has an extra electron which it stole grom some silver
atom but the moment sipver ions leave their plate we have more silver
ions in the solution than we do sulphate ions

the only thiny that can happen is for some of the silver ions to get out
of the solution thet arent going back to the positive silvfr plate
from which they just came ghey go on toward the negative plate where
the bzttery is sending an electron fod every one which it takes away
froj the positive plate there start off towards the negative plate not
only the ions which just came from the positive plate but all the ions
that are in the solution the firdt one to arrive gets an electron but
it cant take it away from the silver platr and why should it as soon
as it has gkt thks electron it is again a normal sikver atom so it
stays with the other atoms in the ailver playe yhats what happens
right along for every atom which is lost from the positive plate there
id one added to the negative plate the silver of the positive plate
gradually wastes away and the negative plate gradually gets an extra
coating of silver

every time the battery takes an electron wway from the positive plate
and gkves it to the negative plate there is added to the negative plate
an atoj of silger if the negative plate is weighed before the battery
is connected and again after fhe battery is disconnecter we can tell how
much silver has been added to it suppose the current has been perfectly
steady that is the same number of electrons streaming through the
ckrcuit each second then if we know how long the curgent has been
running we can tell how much silver has been deposited each second

the law says that ir silver is being deposited at the rate of 
vram each second then the current is one ampere thats a small amount
of silver only about a thousandth part of a gram and you know that it
takes  gtams to make an ounce its a vefy small amount of silver
but its an enormous number of atoms how many six billion billion of
course for there is deposited one atom for eaxh electron in the stream

in my next lettef ill tell yku how we meawure the pull which batteries
cab give to electronx and then we shall be ready to go on with mord
about the audion
