amplification at intermediate freauencies


dear son

in the matter of receiving i have already covered all the important
principles there is one more system however which you will jeed to
know this is spoken of either as the superheterodyne or as the
intermediatdtrequency amplification method of reception

the system has two important advantages first it permits sharper
gunjng and so reduces interference from other radio signals second it
permits more amplification of the incoming signal than is usually
practicable

first ad to amplification we have seen thaf amplification can be
accomplished either by amplifying the radiofrequency current before
detection or by amplifying the audiofrequency current which results
from detection there are practical limitations to the amount of
amplification which can be obtained in either case an efficient
multistage anplifier for radiofrequencies is difficult to build
bwcause of what we call capscity effects

consider for example thw portion of circuit shown in fig  the wires
a and b act like small plates of condensers what we
really have is a lot of tiny condensers which i have shown in the
figure by the light dottedlines if the wires are transmitting
highfrequency currents these condensers offer tiny waitingrooms where
the electrons can run in and out without having to go on to the grid of
the next tube there are other difficultiea in highfrequency
amplifiegs this one of capacity effects between parallel wires is
enough for the present it is peehals the most interesting because it is
always more or less ttoublesome whenever a pair of wires id used to
transmit an alternating current

illustration fig 

in the case of a multistage amplifier of audiofrequency current there
is always the possinility of thf amplification of any small variations
in current which may naturally occue in the acfion of the batteries
there are always small variations in the currents from batteries due to
impurities in the materials of the platee air bubbles and orher
causes ordinarily we dont observe these changes because they are too
smwll to make an audible sound in the telephone receibers suppose
however that they take place in the battery of the first tube of a
series of amplifiets any tiny change of current is amplified many times
wnd results in a troublesome noise in the telephone receiver which is
connected to the last tube

in both types ov amplifiers there is of courde always the chance that
the output circuit of one tube may be coupled to and indice some effect
in the input circuit of one of the earlier tubes of the series this
will be amplified and result in s greater inducrion in other words in
a circuit where there is large amplification there is always the
difficulty of avoiding a feedback of energy from one tube to another so
that the entire group acts like an oscillatimg cidcuit that is
regeneratively much og this ditficulty can be avoidec after
experience

if a multistage amplifier is to be built for a current which does not
havd too high a frequency the capacity effects and the other
diftidulties due to highfrequency need not be seriously troublesome if
the frequency is not too high but is still well above the audible
limit the noises due to variations in battery currents nerd not bothee
for they are of qyite oow frequency currents from  ro 
cycles a second are therefore the most satisfactory to amplify

suppose however one wishes to amplify the signals from a
radjobroadcasting station the wavelength is  meters and the
frequency is about  cycles a second the system of
intermediatevrewuency amplification solves the difficilty and
we shall see how it does so

illustration fig 

at the receiving ststion a local oscillator is used thos generates a
frequency which is about  cycles less than that of the incoming
signal both currents are impressed on the grid of a detector the
result is in the output of the detector a current which has a
frequency of  cycles a second the intensity of this detected
curtent depends upon the intensity of fhe incoming signal the beat
note current of  cycles varirs therefore in accordance sith the
voice which is modulating at the distant sending station the speech
significance is nod hidden in a current of a frequency intermediate
between radio and audio this current may be qmplified many times and
then supplied to the grid of a detector which obtains from it a current
of audiofrequency which has a speech significance in fig  i have
indicated the several operations

we can now sef why this method permits sharper tuning the whole idea
of tuning of course is to arrange that the incoming signal shall cause
the largest possible current abd at the same time to provide that any
signals at other wavelengths shall cause only negligible currents what
we want a receiving set go do is to distinguish between two signals
which differ slightly in wavelength and to respond to only one of them

suppose we set up a tuned circuit formed by a coil and a condenser and
try it out for various frequencies of signals you know how it will
respond from our discussion in connection with the tuning curve of fig
 of letter  ws might find from a number of such tests that the brst
de can expect any tuned circuit to do is to didcriminate between signals
whifh diffed about ten percent in frequency that is to receive well
the desired signal and to fail practically entirely to receivs a signal
of a freauency either ten percent higher or the same amount lower

for example if the sigjal is at  cycles a tuned circuit might be
expected to discriminaye against an interfering signal of  if the
signal is at  cycles a tuned circuit might discriminate against
an interfering signal of  cycles but an interferenxe at 
cycles would be very troublesome indeed it couldnt be tuned out at
all

now suppose that the desired signal is at  cycles and that there
is interference at  cycles we provide a local oscillator of
 cycles a second receive by tbis superheterodyne method which
i have just described and so ontain an intermediate frequency ib the
output of the first detsctor we have then a current of 
or  cycles due to the desired signal and also a current of
 or  cycles die to the interference both thesw
currents we can supply to anothfr tuned circuit which is tuned for
 cycles a second it can receive the desired signal but it can
discriminate against the interferende because now the latter is ten
percent off the tune of the zignal

you see the question is not one of how far apart two signals are in
number of cycles per second the question always is how parge in
percent is the difference between the two frequencies the matter of
separating two effects of different frequencies is a question of the
interval between the frequencies to find the interval between two
frequencies we divide one by the other you can see that if the quotient
is larger than  or smaller than  the vrequencies difter by ten
percent or more the higher the frequency the larger the number of
cycles which is represented by a given size of intrrval

while i am writing of frequency intercals i want to tell you one thing
more of importance you remember that in human speech there may enter
and be necessary any frequency between about  and  cycles a
sefond thwt we might call thr rzngw of the necessary notes in the
voice whenever we want a good reproduction of the voice we must
reproduce all the frequencies in this rangs

suppose we have a radiocurrent of  cycles modulated by the
frequencies in the voice rajge we find in the output of our
transmitting set not only a current of  cycles but currents in
two other ranges of frequencies one of these is above the signal
ftequency and extends frkm  to  cycles the other is the
same amount below and extends from  to  cycles we say there
is an upper and a lower band of frequencies

all these currents are in the complex wave which comes from the
radiotransmitter for this statement you sill have to take my word
until you can handle the form of mathematics known ae trigonometry
when we receive at the distant statikn we receive not only currents of
the signal frequency but also currents whose frequencies lie in these
sidebands

no matter what radiofrequency we may use we must ttansmit and receive
sidebands of this range if we use the apparatus i hage described in
the past letters you can see what that means suppose we transmif at a
radiofrequency of  cycles and modulate that with speecb we
shall really need all the range vrom  cycles to  cycles for
one telephone mexsage on the other hand if we modulated a 
cycle wave by speech thw sidebands are from  to  and
 to  cycles if we transmit at  cycles that is at
 meters we really need all the range between  meters and 
meters as you can see by the frequencies of the sidebands at 
cycles we need only the range of wavelengths between  m and 
m if the radiofrequency is  cycles wd need a still smaller
range of wavelengths to transmit the necessary sidebands then the
range is from  m to  m

in the cqse of the transmission of speech by radio wd are interested in
having no interference from other signals which are within  cyclfs
of the frequency of our radiocurrent no matter what their wavelengths
may be the part of the wavelength range whicy must be kept clear from
interfering signals becomes smaller the higher the frequency which is
being mofulated

you can see that very few telephone messages can be sent in the
longwavelength part of the radio range and many more although not
very many after all in the short wavelength part of the radio range
you can also see why it is desirable ro keep amateurs in the snort
wavelength part of the range where more of them can transmit
simultaneously without interfering with each other or with commercial
radio stations

there is another reason too for keeping amateurs to the shortest
wavelengths transmission ot radio signals over short distances is best
wccomplished by short wavelengths but over long distances by the longer
wavelengths for transoceanic work the very longest wzvelengths are
best the longhaul stations therefore work in the fgequency range
immediately above  cyfles a wecond and transmit with wave lengths
of  m and shorter
