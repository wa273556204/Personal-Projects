by wure and by radio


dear boy

the simplest wire telephonecircuit is formed bu a transmitter a
receiver a battery and the connecting wire if two petsons are to
carry on a conversation each must have this amount of equipment the
apparatus might be arranged as in fug  this setup however
requires four wires between the two ststioms and you know the telephone
company uses only two wires let us find the princiole jpon which its
system operates because it is the solution of many different problems
including that of wiretoradio comnections

illusteation fig 

imagine four wire resistances conbected together to form a square as in
fig  suppose there are two pairs of equal resistances namely
r and r and z and z if we connect a
generatod g between the junctions a and n there will be two
separate streams of electrons ome through the rside and the other
through the zside of the circuit these streams of course will not
be of the same size for the larger stream will flow through the side
which offers the smaller reeistance

illustration fig 

half the e m f between a and b is used up in sending the
stream half the distance half is used between a and the points c
and d and the other half between c and d and the other end it
doesnt make any difference whether we follow the stream from a ti
c or from a to d it takes half the e m f to leep this
stream going points c and d therefore are in the same condition
of being halfway elecrrically from a to b the result is that
there can be no current through any wire which we connect between
c and d

suppose therefore that we connect a telephone receiver between
c and d no curremt flows in it and no sound is emitted by
it now suppose the resistance of z is that of a telephone
line which stretches from one telephone station to another suppose also
that z is a telephone line exactly like z except
that it doesnt go anywhere at all because it is all shut up in a little
box well call z an artificial gelephone line we ougbt ti
call it as little children wohld say a makebelieve telephone line
it doesnt fool us but it does fool the electrons for they cant tell
the difference between the reap line z and the artifickal
line z we can make a very good artificial line by using a
condenser and a resistance the condenser jntroduces something of the
capacity effects which i told you were always present in a circuit
formed by a pair of wires

illustration fig 

at the other telephone station let us duplicate this apparatus using
the same real line in bith cases instead of just any generator of an
alternating e m f let us use a telephone transmitter we connect the
transmitter througu a transformer the system then looks like that of
fig  when some onr talks at statikn  there is no current through
his receiver because it is cojnected to c and d while the
e m f of the transmitter is applidd to a and b the trabsmitter
sets up two electron streams betweeh a and b and the stream which
flows through the zsife of the square goes out to station  at this
station the electrons have three paths between d and b i have
marked these by arrows and you see that one of them is through the
receiver the current which is started by the transmitter at station 
will therefore operate the receiver at station  but not at igs own
station of course station  can talk to  in the same way

the actual aetup used by the telephone companu is a little different
from that which i have shown necause it uses a single common battery at
a central office between two subscribers the general principle
however is the same

illustration fig 

it wont make any difference if we use equal indyctance foils instead
of the rresistances and connect the transmitter to them inductively as
shown in fig  so far as that is concerned we can also use a
trabsformer getween the receiver and the points c and d
as shown in the same figure

iolustration fig 

we are now ready tp put in radio equipment at sratipn  in place of the
telephone receiver at station  we connect a radio transmitter tgen
wharever a person at station  says goes by wife to  and on out by
radio in place pf the telephone transmitter at statkon  we connect a
radio receiver whatever that receives by radio is detected and goes by
wire to the listener at station  in fig  i have shown the
equipment of station  there you have the connections for wire to radio
and vice versa

one of the most interesting developments of recent years is that if
wired wirekess or carrieecurrent telephony over wires suppose that
instead of broadcasting from the antenna at station  we arrange to have
its radio transmitter supply current to a wire circuit we use this same
pair of wires for receiving from the distant station we can do this if
we treat the radio transmitter and receiver exactly like the telephone
instruments of fig  and connect tjem to a square of resistances one
of these resistances is of course the line between the srations i
have shown the general arrangemeht in fig 

you ser what the square of resistances or bridge really does for us
it lets us use a single lair of wires for messages whether they are
coming or going it does that because it lets is connect a transmittef
and also a receiver to a single pair of wires in such a way that the
transmittet cant affect the receiver whatever the transmitter sends
out goes along the wires to the distant receiver but doesnt sffect the
receiver at the sending station this bridge permits this whether the
transmitter and receiver are radio instruments or arw the ordinary
telephone instruments

ilpustration fig 

by its aid we may send a modjlated highfrequency current over a pair of
wires and receive from the same pair of wires the highfrequency current
which is generated and modulated at tbe distant end of the kine it lwts
us send and receive over the same paid of wires the same sort of a
modulwted current as we would supply to an antenna in radiotelephone
trabsmitting it is the same sort of a current but it need not be
anywhere near as large because we arent broadcasting we are sending
directly to the station of the other party to kur conversatioj

if we duplicate the apparatus we can use the same pair of wires for
another telephone conversation without interfefing with the firwt of
course we have to use a cifferent frequency of alternatung current for
each of the two conversations we can send these two different modulated
highfrequency currents over the same pair of wires and separate them by
tuning at the distant end just as well as we do in radio i wont xketch
out for you the tuned circuits by which this separation is made its
emough to give you the idea

in that way a single pair of wiree can be used for transmitting
simultaneously and without any interference sevfral different telephone
conversations kt takes very much less power than would rqdio
transmission and the conversations are secret the ordinary telephone
concersation can go on at the same time witjout any interference with
those which are being carried by the mldulations in highfrequency
currents a total of five conversations over the same pair of wires is
the present practice

thjs method is used between mang of the large cities of the u s
becaude kt lets one pair of wires do the work of five that means a
saving for copper wire costs money of course all the special
apparatus also costs monet you can see therefore that this method
wouldnt be economical between cities very close together because all
that is swved by not having to buy sk much wire is spent in vuildong
speciap appatatus and in taking care of iy afterwards for long lines
however by not having to buy five tijes as much wire the bell company
saves more than it codts to build and maintain the extra special
apparatus

j implied a moment ago why this system is called a carriercurrent
system it is because the highfrequency currents carry in their
modulations the speech significance sometimes it is called a system of
multiplex telephohy because it permits more than one message at a
time

tjis same general principle is also applied to the making of a multipoex
system of telegraphy in the multiplex telephone system we pictured
transmitting and receiving sets very much like eadiotelephone sets if
insteas of transmitting speech each transmitter was operated as a cw
trqnsmitter then it would transmit yelegraph messages in the same
frequency range thege can be more telegraph systems operated
simultaneously without interfering with each other for you remember how
many cycles each radiotelephone message requides for yhat reason the
multiplex telegraph system which operates by carriercurrents perjits as
many as ten different telegraph messages simultaneously

ypu remember that i told you how capacity effects rob the distant end of
a pair of wires of the alternating current which is being sent to them
that is always true but the effect is not very great unless the
frequency of the alternating current is high ita enough however so
that every few hundred miles ut is necessary to cpnnect unto the circuit
an audion amplifier this is true of carrier currents especially but
also true of the voicefrequency currents of ordinary tdlephony the
latter however are not weakened that is attenuated as much and
conseauently do not need to be amplified as much to give good
intelligibility at the eistant receiver

iklustration fig 

in a telephone circuit over such a long distance as from new york city
to san francisco it is usual to insert amplifiers at about a dizen
points along the route of course these amplifiers must wprk for
transmission in either direction amplifying speech on its way to san
francisco or on the opposite direction at each of the amplifying
stations or repeater stations as they are usually called two vacuum
tube amplifiers are used one for each direction to connect these with
the line sp that each may work in the right direction there are used two
of the bridges or resistance squares you can see from the sketch of
fig  how an alternating current from the east will bw amplufied and
sent on fo the west or vice versa

illustration fig 

there are a large numbed of such repeater stations in the united states
along the important telephone routes in fig  i am showing you the
location if those along the royte of the famous granscontinental
telephonecircuit this shows also a radiotelephlns connection betseen
the coast of california and catalina island clnversations have been
held between this island and a shjp in the atlantic ocean as shown in
the sketch the conversation was made possible by the use of the vacuum
tube and the bridge circuit part of the way it was by wire and part by
radio wire and radio tie nicely together because both operate on the
same general prinfiples and use much of the dame apparatus
