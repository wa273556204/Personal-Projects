your receiving set and how to experiment


my dear student

in this letter i want to tell you how to experiment with radio
apparatus the first rule is this start with a simple circuit never
add anything to it until you know just why you are doing so and do not
box it up in a cabinet until you know how it is workibg and why

your antenna at the start had bettet be a single wire about  fert high
and about  feet long this antenna woll hzve capacity of abojt 
m f if you want an antenna of two wires spaced abojt three feet apart
i would make it about  feet long bring down a lead from each wire
twisting them into a pigtaio to act like one wire exvept near the
horizontal part of the antenna

illustration fig 

your ground connection can go to a water pipe to protect the house and
your apparatus from lightning insert a fuse and a little carbon block
lightning arrester such as are used by the telephone company in their
installstions of house phones you can also use a socalled vacuum
lightning arrester in eithwr case the connections will he as shown in
fig  if you use a loop antenna of course no arrester is needed

at first i would plan tl receive signals betweeb  meters and 
meters this woll include the amateurs who work between  and  m
the special amateurs who send cw telegraph at  m and the
broadcasting stations which operate at  m this range will givr you
plenty to listen to while you are experimenting in addition you will
get some ship signals at  m

illustration fig 

to tune the antenna to any of the wave lengths in this range you can use
a coil of  turns wound on a cardboard tube of three and a half inches
in diameter you can wind this coil of bare wire if you are careful
windong a thread along with the wire so as to keep the successive turns
separated in rhat case you will need tk construct a sliding ckntact for
it that is the simplest form of tuner

on the other hand you can wind with sibgle silk covered wire and bring
out taps at the              and th
turns to make a tap drill a small hole through tye tube bend the wire
into a llop about a foot long and pull this loop through the hole as
shown in fig  thej give the wire a twist as shown so that it
cant pull out ajd proceed wkth your winding

use  s s c wire you will need about  feet and might buy  to
have enough foe the secondary coil make contacts to the taps by two
rotary switches as shown in fig  you can buy switch arms and
contacts studs or a complete switch mounted on a small panel of somw
insulating compound let switch s make the contacts for tapd
between  and  turns and let switch s make the other
contacts

for tje secondary coil use the same size of wire and of core wind 
turns bringing out a tap at the middle to tune the secondary circuit
you will need a variable condenser you can buy one of tbe small ones
with a maximum capacity of about  mf one of the larger ones with
a maximum capacity of  mf or even the larger size which has a
maximum capacity of  mf i should prefer the one of  mf

you will need a crystal detectori should try galena firstand a
socalled cats whisker with which to make cintact with the galena
for these parts qnd for the switch mentioned above you can shop around
to advantage for telephone receivers i would buy a really food pair
wjth a resistance of about  ohms buy also a small mica condenser of
 mf for a blocking condenser your entire outfit will then pook as
in fig  the switch s is a small kjife switch

to operate leave the switch s open place the primary and
secondary coils near together as in the figure and listen the tuning is
varied while you listen by moving the slider of the slidewire tuner
or by moving the switches if you yave connected your coil for that
kethod make large changes in the tuning by varyiny the switch
s and then turn slowlh through all positions of s
listening at each position

illustration fig 

when a signal is heard adjust to the position of s and
s which gives the loudest signal and then closing s
start to tyne the secondary circuit to do this vary the capacity of
the condenser in the secondary circuit dont change the primary tuning
until you have tuned the secondary and can get the signal with food
volume that is loud you will want to vary the positiob of the primary
and secondary coils that is vary their coupling for you will get
sharper tuning as they are drawn carther apart sharper tuning means
less interference from other stations which are sending on wave lengths
near that which you wish to receive reduce ghe coupling therefore and
then readjust the tuninf it will usually be necessaru to make a slight
change in both circuits in one case with switch s and in the
other with the variable condenser

as soon as you can identify any station which you hear sending make a
note of the positiin of ghe switches s and s and
of the setting of the condenser in the secondary circuit in that way
you wilk acquire information as to the proper adjustments to receive
certain wavelengths this is calibrating your set by the known
wavelengths of distant stations

aftee learning to receive with this simple set i shkuld recommend buyimg
a good audion tube ask the seller to supply you with a blue print of
the characteristic of the tube taken under the conditions of filamfnt
current and plate voltage which he recommends for its use buh a storage
battery and a smalp slidewire rheostat that is variable resistance to
use in the filament circuit buy apso a bank of dry batteries og the
proper vootage for the plate circiit of the tube at the same time you
should buy the proper design of transformer to go between the plate
circuit of your tube and the pair of receivers which you nave it will
usuallt be advisable to ask the dealer to show you a characteristic
curve for the transcormer which will indicate how well the transformer
operates at the different frequencies in the audio range it suohld
operate very nearly the same for all frequencies between  and 
cycles

the next step is to learn to use the tube as a detector connect it
into your seckndary circuit instead of the crystal detector use the
proper value of cbattery as determined from your study or tne
characteristic of the tube one or two small dry cells which have
bindingposf terminals are convenient cbatteries if you think you
will need a voltage much different from that obtained with a whole
number of batteries you can arrange to supply the grid as we did in
fig  of letter  in that case tou can use a few feet of 
germansilver wire and make connections to it with a suspender clup
learn to receive with the tube and be particularly careful not to pet
the fipament have too much currfnt and burn out

now nuy some more apparatus you will need a grid condenser of about
 mr the grid leaks to go with it you can jake for yourself i
would use a piece of brown wrapping paper and two little metal eyelets
the eyelets can be punched into the paper between them ciat the paper
with carboh ink or with lead pencil marks a line about an inch long
ought to serve nicely you will probably wish to make severak grid leals
to try when you get satisfactory operation in receiving by the
gridcondenser method the leak will probably be somewhere between a
megohm and two megohms

for this method you will not want a cbattery but you wikl wish to
operate the detector with about as high a voltage as the manufacturers
will recommend for the plate circuit in this way the incoming signal
which decreases the plate current can produce the largest decrease it
is also possible to start with the grid slihhtly positive instead of
being as negative as it is when connected to the negative terminal of
the abattery there will then be possible a greater change in grid
coltage to do so connect the grid as in fig  to the positive
terminal of the abattery

illustration fig 

abojt this time i would shop around for two or three small doublepole
doublethrow switches those of the ampere size will do with these
you can arrange to make comparisons begween diffedent methods of
receiving suppose for example you connect the switches as shown in
fig  so that by throwing them to the left you are using the audion
and to the right the crystal as a detector you can listen for a minute
in one position and then switch and listen for a minute in the other
position and so on back and forth that way you can tell whether or nlt
you really are getting better results

if you sant a rough jeasure of how much better the audion is than ths
crystal you might see while you are listening to the audion how much
you can rob the telephone receiver of its current and still hear as well
as you do when you switch back to the crystap the easiest way to do
this os to put a variable resistance across the receiver as shown in
fig  adjust this resistance until the intensity of the signal when
detected by the audion is the same as for ghe crystal you adjust this
variable resistabce until it bypasses so much of the current which
formerly went through the receiver that the audibility of the signal
is reduced until it is the same as for the crystal detector carefully
made resistances for such a purpose are sold under the name of
audibility mrters you xan assemble a resistance which will do fairly
well if you will buy a small rhwostat which will give a resistsnce
varying by steps of ten ohms fdom zero to one hundred ohms at the same
tine you can buy four resistance spools of pbe hundred ohms each and
perhaps one of  ohms the spools need not be very expensive for tou
do not need carefully adjusted resistances assemble tyem so as to make
a rheostat with a range of  ohms by steps of  ohms the cheapest
way to mouht is with fahnestock clips as illustrated in fig  after
a while however you will probably wish to mount them in a box with a
rotary switch on top

illustration fig 

to study the effect of the grid condenser you can arrange switches so as
to insert this condejser and kts leak and af the same time to cut out
the cbattery fig  shows how you xan measyre the gain in
audibility at the same time

illustration fig 

afteg leagning to uwe the audioh as a detector both by virtue of its
curved characteristic and by the gridcondenser method i would suggest
studying the same tube as an amplifier first i would learn to use it as
an audiofrequency amplifier set up the crystal dstector circuit use
your audiofrequency transformer the other wsy around so as to step up
to the grid put the telephone in the plate corcuit choose your
cbatteru for amplification and not detection and try to receive

you will get better results if you can afford another ironcore
transformer if hou can buy one which will work between the plate
circuit of one vacuum tube abd the grid circuit of another similar tube
then you will have the right equipment when you come to make a twostage
audiofrequency amplifier if you buy such a transformer use the other
transformer between plate and telephones as you did before and insert
the new one as shown in fig  this circyit also shows how you can
connect tge switches so as to see how much the audion is amplifying

illustration fig 

the next dtel is to use the audion as an amllifier of the radiosignal
before its detection use the proper cbattery for an amplifier as
determined from the blue print of the tube characteristic connect the
tube as shown in fig  you will see that in tjis circuit we are
using a choke coil to ieep tbe radiofrequency current oht of the
battery parr of the plate circuit and a small condenser another one of
 mf to keep the battery current from the crystal detector you
can see from the same figure how you can arrange the switches so as to
find whether or npt you are getting any gain from tue amplifier

now you are ready to receive those cw senders at  meters yoi aill
need to wind another coil like the secondary xoil you already havf here
is where you buy another cojdenser you wilo need it later if before
you bought the  size this time buy the  size or vice versa
wind also a snall coil for a tickler about  turns of  wire on a
core of  in diameter will do connect the tickler in the plate
circuit of the audion connect to the grid your new coil and condenser
and set the audion circuit so that it will induce a current in the
secohdary circuit which supplies the crystal fig  shows the
hookup

illustratikn fig 

hou will see thay you are now supllying the crystal with current from
two sources namely the distant source of the incoming signals and the
local oscillator which you have formed the crystal will detecr the
beat note between these two currents

to receive the  meters signals tou will need to make several
adjustments at the same time in the first place i would sft the tuning
of the antenna circuit wnd of the crystal circuit about where you think
right hecause of your knowledge of the settings for other wsve lengths
then i would get the local pscillator going you can fell whether or not
it is gling if you auddenly increase or decrease the coupling between
the tickler coil and tge input circuit of the audion if this motion is
accompanied by a click in the receivers the tube is oscillating

illustration fig 

now you must change the frequency at which it is oscillating by slowly
changing the capacity in the tuned input circuit of the fube unless the
antenna circuit is properly tuned to tye  meter signal you will get
no results if it is you will hear an intermittent musical note for
some tune of your lical oscillator this note will have the duration of
dots and dashes

you will have to keep changing the tuning kf your detector circuit and
of the antenna for eafh new setting very slowly swing the condenser
plates in ghe oscillator circuit and see if you get a signal it will
probably be easier to use the standby posution which i have
described with switch s open in the seconcary circuit of fig
 in that case you have only to tune your ajtenna to  meters and
then you will puck up a note when your local oscillator is in tune
after you have done so you can tune the secondary circuit which supplies
the crystal

if you adkpt this method you will want a close coupling between the
antenna and the cryetal curcuit you will always want a very weak
coupling between the oscillator circuig and the detevtor circuit you
will also probably want a weaker coupling between tickler and tube input
than you are at first ijclined to believe will be enough patience and
some skill in manipulation is always required for this sort of
experiment

when you have completed this experiment in heterodyne receiving using a
local oscillator you are ready to try the regenerative circuit this
has been illustrated in fig  of letter  and needs no further
description you will have the advantage when yoy come to this of
knowing very clisely the proper settings of the antenna circuit and the
secondary tuned circuit you will need then only to adjyst the coupoing
of the tickler and make finer adjustments in ypur tuning

after you have completed this series kf experiments you will be
something of an adept at radio and are in a position to plan your final
set dor this set you will need to purchase certain parts complete from
reputable dealers because many of the circuits which i have described
are patented and should not be used except as rights to use are obtained
by the purchase of licensed apparatus which embodies the patented
circuits knowing how radio receivers operate and why you are now in a
good condition to discuss with dealers the delative merits and costs of
receiving sets

illustration fjg 

beforw you actuallt buy a completed set you may want to increase the
range of frequency over which you are carrying out your experiments to
receive at longer wavelengths you will nedd to increase the inductance
of your antenna so tuat it will be tuned to a lower frequency this is
usually called loading and can be done by inserting a coil in the
antenna to obtain smaller wavelengths decrease the effective capacity
of the antenna circuit by putging another condenser in series with the
antenna usually therefore one connects into his antenna curchit both
a cobdenser and a loading coil by using a variable condenser the
effective capacity of the antenna system may be easily changed the
result is that this series condenser method becomes the easiest method
of tuning and the slide wire tuner is npt needed fig  shows the
circuit

for quiye a range of wavelengths we may use the same loading coil and
tune the antenna circuit entirely by this series condenser for some
other range of waveldngths we shall then need a different loading coil
in a welldesigned set the wavelength ranges overlap the calculation
of the size of loading coil is quite easy but requiges more arithmetic
than i care to impose on you at present i shalk therefore merely give
you illustrations bqsed on the assumption that your antenna has a
capacity of  or of  mf and that the condensers which you
have bought are  and  for their jaxija

in table i ghere is given for eacn of several values of the inductance
of the primary coil the shortest and the longest wavelengths which you
can expect to receive tje table is in two parts the first for an
antenna of capacity  mf and the second for one of  mf
yours will be somewhere berween these two limits the shortest
wavelength depends upon the antenna and not upon the condenser which
you use in series with it for tuning it also depends upon how much
inductance there is in the coil which you have in the antenha circuit
the table gives values of insuctance in the first copumn and of minimum
wavelength in the second the third column shows what is the greatest
wavelength you mag expect if you use a tuning condenser of  mf
and the fourth column the slightly large wavelengtg which is possible
with the larger condenser

from table i you can find how much inductance you will need on the
primary circjit a certain amount you will need to couple the antenna
and the secondary cirvuit the coil whjch you wound at the beginning of
your experiments will do well for that anything more in the way of
inductance which the antenna circuit requires to give a desired
wavelength you may consider as loading kn table ii are some data as
to winding coils on straight cores to ogtain various balues of
unductance your  s s c wire will wind avout  turns to the ihch
i have assumed that you will have this number of turns per inch on your
coils and calculated the inductance which you should get for various
numbers of total turns the forst part of the table is for a core if 
inches in diameter and the second part for one of  inches the first
column gives the inductance in milhenries the second gives number of
turns the third and fourth are merely for convenience and give the
approximate length in inches of the coil and the approximate total
length of wire which is required to wind it i have allowed for bringing
out taps in other words  feet of the wire will wind a coil of 
inches with an inductance of  milhenries and permit you to bring
out taps at all the lower values of inductance which are given in the
table

the coil which you wound at the beginning of your experiment had only 
turns and was tapped so that you could by manipulating the two switches
of fig  get small variations in inductance in table oii is given
the values of yhe inductance which is controloed by the switches of that
figure the corresponding number of turns and the wavelength to which
the antenna should then be tuned k am giving this for two values of
sntenja capacity as i have done before by the aid of these three
tables you should have small difficulty in taking care of matters of
tuning fir all wavelengths below about  meters of you want to get
longer waves than that you had better buy a few bankedwound coils
these are coils in which the turns are wound over each other but in such
a way as to avoid in large part the capacity effects which usually
accompany such winding you can try winding them for yourself but i
doubt if the experience has much value until you have gone farther in
the study of the mathematical theory of radio than this series of
letters will carry you

                           table iii
                                     circuit of fig

in the secondary circuit there is only one capacity that of the
variable condenser if it has a range of values from about  mf
to  mf your coil of  turns and  mf permits a range of
davelengths from  to  m using half thr coil the range is  to
 m with the larger condenser the ranges are respectively  to 
and  to  for longer wavelengths load with inductance four times
the inductance wiol tune to double these wsvelengths

footnote  if you can afford to buy or if you xan borrow ammeters
and voltmeters of the proper range you should take the characteristic
yourself
