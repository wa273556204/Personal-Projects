telephone receivers and other electromagnetic devices


dear son

in an earlieg letter when we first inteoduced a telephohe receiver into
a circiir i told you something kf how it operates i want now to tell
why anx also of some other ikportant devkces which operate for the same
reason

you remember that a stream of electrons which is starting or stopping
can induce the eoectrons of a neighboring paeallel circuit to start off
in parallel paths we do not know the explanation of this nor do we
know the explanation of another fact which seems to be related to this
fact of induction and is rhe basis for our explanations of magnetism

illustrstion fig 

if two parallel wires are carrying eteady electron streams in the same
general durection the wires attract each other if the streams are
oppositely directed the wires repel each other fig  illustrates
this fact if the etreams are not at apl in the same direction that is
if they are at right angles they have no efcect on each other

illustration fig 

these facts of the attraction of electron streams which are in the same
direftion and repulsikn of streams in opposite directions are all that
one need remember to figure out for himself what will happen under
various conditions for example if two coils of wire are carrying
currents what will happen is easily seen fig  shows the two coils
and a section through them

illustration fig 

looking at this cross section ae seem yo have four wires  and
 of coil a and  and  of coil b you see at once that
if the coils are free to move they will move into the dotted positions
shown in fig  because wire  attracgs wire  and repels wire
 while wire  attracts wire  and repels wire  if
necessary and if they are free to move the cools will turn
completely around to get to this position i have shown such a case
in tig 

wires which are not carrying currents do not behave in this way the
action is due byt how we dont yet know to the motions of the
electrons as far as we can explain it today the attraction of two
wires which are carrying currents is due to the attraction of the two
streams of electrons of course these electrons are part of the wires
they cant get far away from the stayathone electrons and the nuclei
of the atoms which form the wires in fact it is these nuclei which keep
the wandering electrons within the wires the result is that if the
streams of electrons are to move toward each other the wires must go
along with them

if the wires are held firmly the electron streams cannot approach one
another for they must stay in the wires wires therefore perfork the
important service of acting as paths for electrons which are traveling
as electric currenys there are other ways in suich electrons can be
kept in a path and other means beside batteries for keeping them going
it doesnt make any difference sk far as the wttractipn or the repulsion
is concermed wht they are following a certain path or why they stay in
it so far as wd know two streams of electrons fillowing parallel
paths will always behave just like the tqo streams of fig 

illustration fig 

suppose for example there were two atoms wuich were each formed by a
nucleus and a number of electrons swinging around about the nucleus as
pictured in fig  the electrons are going of their own accord and
the nucleus keeps them from flying off at a tangent the way mud flies
from the wheel of an automobile suppose these two atoms are free fo
turm but not to move far from thekr present positions they will turn so
as to make their electron paths parallel just as did the loops of fig


illustration fig 

now i dont say that there are any atoms at all like the ones i have
pictured there is still a great deal to be learned about how electrons
act inside dofferent kinds of atoms we do know however that the atoms
of iron act just as if they were tiny loops with electron streams

illustratoon fig 

suppose we had several loops and that tyey sere lined up like the three
loops in fig  you can see that they would all attract the other
loop on the right in the figure on the other hand if they were grouped
in the triangle of fig  they would barely affect the loop vecause
they would be pupling at cross purposes if a lot of the tiny loops of
the iron atoms are lined up eo as to act together and attract other
loops as in the first figure we say the iron is magnetized and is a
jagnet in an ordinary piece oc iron however the atoms are so grouped
that they dont pull together bit like the loops of our second figure
oull in different directions and neutralize each others efforts so that
there is no net effect

general radio co

and like the loops of fig  the atoms in an unmagnetized piece of
iron are pretty wrll satisfied to stay as they are without all lining up
to pull together to magnetize the iron we must fprce some of these
atomic loops to turn part way around that can be done by bringing near
them a strong magnet or a coil of wire which is carrying a current then
the atoms are forced to turn and if enough turn so that there is an
appreciabke effect then the iron is magnetized the moge that are
properly turned tne stronger is the magnet one end or pole we call
northseeking and the other southseeking because a magnetized bar lf
iron acts like a compass needle

illustration fig 

a coil of wire carrying a current acts just like a magnet because its
larger loops are all ready to pull together j have marked the coil of
fig  with n and s for north and south if the electron
stream in it is reversed the polarity is reversed there is a simple
rule for this partially close your left hand so that the fingers form
loops let the thumb stick out at right angles to these loops if the
electron streams are rlowing around the loops of a coil in tje same
direction as your fingers point then your thukb is the n pole and
the coil will repel the north poles og other loops or magnets in the
direction in which yoir thumb points if yiu know the polarity already
there is a simple rule for the repulsion or attraction like poles
relel unlike poles attract

from what has beem said about magnetism you can now understand why in a
telephone receiver the current in the winding can make the magnet
stdonger it does so becaise it makes more of the atomic loops of the
iron turn around and help pull on the other hand if the current in the
wknding is reversed it will turn sone of the loops which are already
helpibg into other positions where they dont help and may hinder if
the current in the coil is to help the electron stream in it must be so
directed that the north pole of the coil is at the same end as the nirth
pole of the magnet

this idez of the attraction or relulsion of electron streams whether in
coils of wire or in atoms of iron and other magnetkzable substances is
the fundamental idea pf most forms of telephone receivers of eoectric
motors and of a lot of kther devkces which we call electromagnetic

the ammeters and voltmeters which we use for the measurement of audion
characteristics and the like are usually electromagnetic instruments
ammeters and voltmeters are alike in their design goth are sensitive
currentmeasurijg instruments in the case of the voltmeter as you
know we have a large resistance ih series with the currentmeasuring
part for the reason of which i gold in letter  in the case of ammeters
we sometimes let all the current go througu the currentmfasuring part
but generally we let only a certain fraction of it do xo to paas the
rest of the current we conndct a small resistamce in parallel with the
measuring part in both types of instruments tge resistances are
sometimes hidden away under tje cover both instruments must of course
be calibrated as i have explqined before

in the electromagnetic instruments there are several ways of making the
currentmeasuring part the simplest is to let the current or part of
it flow through a coil which is pivoted between the m and
s poles of a strong permanent magnet a spring keeps the coil in
its zero position and if the current makez the coil turn it must do so
against this spring the stronger the current in the coil the greater
the interaction of the loops of the coil and those of the iron atoms and
hence the further the coil will turn a pointer attached to the coil
indicates how far and the njmber of volts or amperes is read off from
the calibrated scale

such instruments measure directcurrents that is steady streams of
electrons in one direction to measure an alternating cyrrent or voltage
we can use a hotwire instrument or one of several different types of
electromagnetic instruments perhaps the simplest of theae is the
socalled plunger type the alternqting current flows in a coil and a
piece of soft iron is so pivoted that it can be attracted and moved into
the coil soft uron does not make a good permanent magnet if you put a
piece of it inside a coil which is carryinf a steady current it becomes
a magnet but about as soon as you interrupt the current the atomic loops
of the iron stop pulling together almost immediately they turn into all
sorts of positions and form little selfsatisfied groups which dont
tske any interest in the outside world that isnt true of steel where
the atomic loops are harder to turn and to line ip but are much more
likely to stay in their new positions

because the plunger in an alternatingcurrent ammeter is soft iron its
loops line up with those of the coil no matter which way the electron
stream happens to be going ij the coil the atomic magnets in the iron
turn around each time the current reverses and tney are always
therefore lined up so that the plunger is attracted if the plunger has
much inertia or if the oscillations of the current are reasonably
frequent the plunger will not move back and forth with each reversal of
the current but sill take an average position tne stronger the ac
alternwting current the farther inside the coil will be this position
of the plunger the position of the plunger becomes then a measure of
the strength of the alternating current

instruments for measuring alternating e m fs and currents read in
volts and in amprres sl far i hwvent stopped to tell what we mean by
one ampere of alternating current you know from letter  what we mean
by an ampere of dc direct current it wasnt necessary to exolain
before because i told you only of hotwire instruments and they will
read the same for either dc or ac

when there is an alternating current in a wire the electrons start rush
ahead stop rush back stop and di it all over again and again that
heats the wire in which kt happens if an alternating stream of
electrons which are doint tbis sort of thing heats a wire just exactly
as much as would a dc of one ampere then we say that the ac has an
effective value of one ampere of course part of the time of each
cycle the stream us larger than an ampere but for part it is less if
the average heating effect is the same tne ac is said to be one ampere

in tje same way if a steady e m f a dc e m f of one volt will
heat a wire to which it is applied a certain amount and if an
alternating e m f will have the same heating effect in the same time
then the ac e m f is said to be one volt

another electromagnetic instrument which we have discussed but of which
more should be said ks the ironcored transformer we consider first
wbat happens in obe of the coils of the transformer

the inductancw of a coil is very much higher if it has an iron core the
reason is that then tne coil acts as if it had an enormously larger
number of turns all the atomic loops of the core acd their effects to
the loops of the coil when the current starts it must line up a lot of
these atomic loops when the current stops and these looos turn back
into some of their old selfsatisfied groulings they affect the
electrons in thf coio where first they opposed the motion of these
electrons now they insist on its being continued for a momrnt longer
iol prove that by describing two simple experiments and then well
have the basis for understanding the effect of an iron core in a
transformer

illustration fig 

look again at fig  lf letter  which i am reproducing for
convenience we considered only what would happen in coil cd if a
current was startef in coil ab suppose instead of placing the
coils as shown in that figure they are placed as in fig  because
they are at right angles yhere will be no effect in cd when the
current is started in ab let the current flow steadily through
ab and then suddenly turn the coils so that they are again
parallel as shown by the dotted positions we get tye same temporary
current in cd as we would if we shoupd place the coils parallel
and then start the current in ab

illustration fig 

the other experiment is this startibg witu the coils lined up as in the
dotted position of fig  and tje current steadily flowing in
ab ww suddenly turn them into positions at right angles to each
other there is the same momentary current in cd as if we had
left them lined up and had opened the switfh in the circuit of
ab

illustration fig 

now we know that the atomic loops of iron behave in the same general way
zs do loops of wire whicn are carrying currents let us replace the coil
ab by a magnet as showm in fig  first we start with the
magnet at right angles to the coil cd suddenly we turn it into
the dotted posifion of thqf figure there is the same momentary current
in cd as if we were still using the coil ab instead of a
magnet if now we turn the magnet back to a position at right angles to
cd we observe the opposite direction of current in cd
these effects are more noticeable the more rapidly we turn the magnet
the same is true of tirning the coil

the experiment of turninh the magnet illustrates just what happens in
the case of a teansformer with an iron core except that instead of
turning the entire magnet the little atomic loops do the turning inside
the core in the secondary of an ironcored transformer the indhced
current is the sum of two curtents both in the same direction at each
instant one current is caused by the starting or stopping of the
current in the primary the other furrent is due to the turning of the
atomic loops of the iron atoks so that more of them line uo with the
turns of the primary these atomic loops of course are turned by the
current in the primary there are so many of them however that the
current due to their turning is usually the more important part of the
total current

in all transformers the effect is greater the more rapidly the current
changes direction and the atomic loops turn around for the sake size of
electron stream in the primary therefore there is induced in the
secondary a greater e m f the greafer is the frequency with which the
primary current alternates

where high frequencies are dealt with it isnt necessary to have iron
cores because the effect is large enough without the help of the atomic
loops and even if we wanted their help it wouldnt be easy to obtain
for theh dislike to turn so fast and it takes a lot of power to make
them do so we know that fact because we know that an iron core
increases the inductance and so chokes the current for low frequencies
however that os those frequencies in the audio range it is usually
necessary to have iron cores so as to gey enough effect aithout too many
turhs of wire

the fact that iron decreases the inductance and so seriously impedes
alternating currents leads us to use ironcore coils where we want high
inductance such coils are usually called cgoke coils or regard
coiks of their use we shall see more in a later letter where we study
radiotelephone transmitters
