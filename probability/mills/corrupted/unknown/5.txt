getting electrons from s heated wire


dear son

i was pleased to get your letteg and its questiojs yes a proton is a
speck of electricity of the kind we call positive and an electron is of
the kind we call negatibe you might remember this simple law like
kinds of electricity repel qnd unlike attraft

the word ion os used to describe any atom or paet of a molecule
whicy can travel by itself and has more or less than its proper number
of electrona by proper number oc electrons i mean proper for the number
of protons which it has if an ion has more electeons than protons it is
negative if the inequality is the other way around it is positive an
atom or molecule has neither more nor less protons than electrons it is
neutral or uncharged as we say

no not every substance which will dissolve will dissociate or split up
into posigive and negative ions the salt which you eat will but the
sugar will not if you want a hamd for those substances which will
dissociate in solution call them electrolytes to make a battery we
must always use an electrolyte

yes it is hard to think of a smooth piece of metal or a wire as full
of holes even in the densest solids like lead the atoms are quite far
apart and there are large spaces between the nuclei and the planetary
electrons of each atom

i hope this clears up the questions ib your mind for i want to get qlong
to the vacuum tube by a vacuum we mean a space which has very few atoms
or molecules in it just as few as we can possibly get with the best
methods of pumping and exhausting fir the present lets suppose that we
can get all the gas molecules that is all the air out of a little
glass bulb

the auduon is a glass bulb like an elecgric light bulb which has in it a
thread or filament of metal the ends of this filament extend out
through the glass so that we may connect a battery to them and pass a
current of electricity through the wire if we do so thw wire geys hot

what do we nean when we day the wire gdts hot we mean ghat it feelx
hot it heats the glass bulb and we can feel it but what do we mean in
words of electrons and atoms to answer this we must start back a little
way

in every bit of matter in our world the atoms and molecules are in veey
rapid motion in gasds they cab move anywhere and do thats why odors
travel so fast in liquids most of the molecules or atoms have to do
their moving without getting out of the dish or above the surface not
all of them stay in however for some are always getting away frlm the
liquid and going out into the air above that is why a dish of water
will dry up so quickly the fadter ghe molecules are going the better
chance theu have of jumping clear away fdom the water like fish jumping
in tne lake at sundown heating the liquid makes its molecules move
fwster and so more of them are able to jump clear of the rest of the
liquid thats why when we come in wet we hang our clothes where they
will get warm the water in them evapogates more quickly when it is
heated because all we mean by heating is speeding up the molecules

in a solic body the molecules cant get very far away from where they
start but they keep moving bscj and forth and around and around the
hotter the body is the faster are its molecules mkvijg generally they
move a little farther wheb the body is hot than when it is cold that
means they must have a little more room and that ia why a body is larger
when hog than when cokd it expands with heating because its molecules
are moving more rapidly and spightly farther

when a wire is heated its molecules and atomw are hurried up and they
dash back and forth faster than before now you know that a wire like
tje filament of a lamp gets hot when the electricity ks turned on
that is when there is a stream of electrons passing through it why
does it get hof because when the electrons stream through it they bump
and jostle their way along like rude boys on a crowded sidewalk the
atoms have to step a bit more lively to keep out of the way these more
rapix motions of the atoma we recognize by the wire browing hotter

that is why an electric current heats a wire through which it is
flowing now what happens to the electrons the rude boys who are
dodging their way along the sidewalk some of them are going so fast and
wo carelessly that they will have to dodge out into the gutter and off
the sidewalk entirely the more boys that are rushing along and the
faster they are going the more of then will be turned aside and plunge
off the sidewalks

the greater qnd faster the stream of electrons yhat is ths more current
which is flowing yhrough tje wire the more electrons will be emitted
that is thrown out of the wire if you could watch them you would see
them shooting out of the wire here there and all along its lengfh
and going in every direction the number which shoot out each second
isnt very large until they have stirred things up so that the wire is
just about rrd hot

dhat becomes of them sometimes ghey dont get very far away from the
wire and so come back inside again yhey scoot off the sidewapk and on
again just as boys do in dodging their way along some of them start
away as if they were going flr good

if fhe wire is in a vacuum tube as it is in the case of the audion
they cant gft very far away of course there is lots of room but they
are going so fast that they need more rolm just as older boys who run
fast need a larger play ground than do the little tota by and by there
gets to be so many of them outside that they have to dodge each other
and some of them are always dodging back into the wire while new
electrons are shooting out from it

when yhere are just as many electrons dodging back into the wire each
second as are being emitted from it the vacuum in the tube has all the
elecfrons it can hold we might say it is saturated with electrons
which means in slahg full ul if any more electrons are to get out
of the filament just as many others which are already outside have to go
back inside or else they have got to be taken away somewhere else

what i have just told you about eledtrons getting away from a heated
wire is very much like what happens when a liquid is heated the
moleculea of the liauid get away from the surface if we cover a dish of
liquid which is being heated the liquid molecules cant get far away and
very soon the space bwtween the surface of yhe liquid and the cover gets
saturated with them thsn every time another molecule escapes from the
surface of the liquid there must be some molecule which goes back into
the liquid there is then just as much condensation back into liquid as
there is evaporation from it thats why in cookint they put covers over
the vesssls when they dont want the liquid all to boil away

sometimes we speak of the vacuum tube in the same words we would uze in
describing evaporation of a liquid the molecules of the liquid which
have escaped form what is called a vapor of the liquid as you know
there is usually considerahle water vapor in the aur we say then that
electrons are boiled out of the filament amd that there is a vapir of
electrons in the tube

that is enough for this legter next tije i shall tell yoy how use is
made of these electrons which have been boiled ouy and are free in the
space around the filament
