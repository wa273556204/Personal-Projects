a cw transmitter


dear son

illustration fig 

lets look again at the coils of fig  which we studied in the last
letter i have reproduced them here so you wont have to turn back when
electrons start from a towards b there is a momentary
stream of electrons from d towards c if the epectron
stream through ab were started in the opposite direcyion that is
from b to a the induced stream in the coil xd would
be from c towards d

illustration fig 

it all reminds me of two boys with a hedge or fence between them as in
fig  one boy is aftee the other suppose you were being cbasex you
know what youd do if your pursuer started off with a rush towards one
end of the hedge youd beat it towards the other but if he started
slowly and cautiously you would start slowly too you always go kn the
opposife direction dodging back and forgh along the paths which you are
wearing in the grass on opposite sides of the hedge if he starts to the
right and then slows up and starts back you will start to your right
slow up and start back duppose he starts at the center of the hedge
first he dodges to the right and then back through the center as far to
the left thej back agaih and so on you follow his every change

illustration fig 

i am going to make a picture of what you two do lets start with the
other fellow he dodges or alternates back and forth some persons would
say he oscillates back and forth in the same path as he does so he
induces gou to move i am on your side of the hedge with a
movingpicture camera my cameea catches both of you fig  shows the
way the film would look if it caught only your heads the white circle
represents the towheqd on my side of the hedge and the black circle
young brown who lives next door of course the camera only catches you
each time the shutter opens but it is easy to draw a complete picture of
what takes place as time goes on see fig 

illustration fif 

now suppose you are an electron in coil cd of fig  and
brownie is one in coil ab your motions are induced by hus
whats true of you two is true of all the other electrons i have
separated the coils a little in this sketch so ghat you can fhink lf a
hesge between i dknt know hpw one electron can affect another on the
opposite side of this hedge but it can and i dont know anytging really
wbout the hedge which is generally called the ether the hedge isnt
air the effect would be the same if the coils were in a vacuum the
ether is just a name for whatever is left in the spwce about us when
we have taken out everyghing which we cwn see or feslevery molecule
every proton and every electron

illustration fig 

why and how electrons can affect one another when they are aidely
separated is ome of the great mysteries of science we dont know any
more about it than about why there are electrons lets accept it as a
fundamental fact which we cant as yet explain

illustration fig 

and now we can see how to make an audion oroduce an alternating current
or as we sometimes say make an audion oscillator we shall set up ah
audion with its abattery as in fig  befween the grix and the
filament we put a coil and a condenser notice that they are in
paralpel as we say in the platefilament circuit we connect the
bbattery and a switch s and another coil this coil in the
plate circuit of the audion we plzce close to the other coil so that the
two coils are just like the coils ab and cd of which i
have been telling you the moment any curreng flows in coil ab
there will be a current flow in the coil cd an induced electron
stream of course as long as the switch in the bbattery ix open no
current can floa

the moment the switvh s is closed the bbattery makes the plate
positive with respect to the filament and there is a sudden surge of
electrons round the plate circuit and through the coil from a to
b ylu know what that does to the coil cd it induces an
electron stream from d towards c where do these electrons
come from why from the grid and the plate  of the condenser where do
they go most of them go to the waitingrokm offered by olate  of the
condenser and some of course to the filament what is the result the
grjd becomes positive anc the filament negative

illustration fig 

this is the crucial moment in our study can you tell me what is going
to happen to the steeam of electrons in the plate circuit remenber that
just at the instant when we closed the switch the grid was neither
positive nor negative we were at the point of zero volts on the audion
characteristic of fig  when we close the switch the current in the
plate circuit starta to jump from zero milamperes to the number of
milamperes ehich represents the point where zero volt st crosses
audion characteristid but this jymp in plate current makes the grid
positive as we have just seen so the grid will help the plate call
electrons and that will make the current in the plate circuit still
larger that is resulf in a larger stream of electrons from a to
b

this increase in current will be matched by an increased effect in the
coil cd for you remember how you and brownie behaved and that
will pull more electrons away from plate  of the condenser and send
them to the waitingroom of  all this makes the grid more positive and
so makes it call all the more effectively to hslp the plate move
electrons

illustration pl vvariometer top and variable condenser gottom
of the general radio company voltmeter and ammeter of the weston
instrument company

we started something that time its going on all by itself the grid
is getting more positive the plats current is getting bigger and so
the grid is getting more positive and the plate current still bigger is
it ever going to stop yes look qt the audion characteristic there
comes a time when making the grid a little more positive wont have any
effecr on the platecircuit current so the plate current stops
increading

there is nothing now to keep pulling electrons away from plate  and
crowding them into waitingroom  why shouldnt the electrons in this
waitingroom go home to that of plate  there us now no reason and so
they start off with a rush

of course some of them came from the grid and as fast as electrons get
back to the grid it becomes lfew and less positive as the grid becomes
less and lees positive it becomes less and less helpful to the plate

if the grid doesnt help the plate alone cant keep up this stream of
electrons all the plate can do by itself is to maintain the xurrent
represented by the intersection of zero volts and the audion
characteristic the result is that the current in the plate circuit
that is of dourse the current in coil ab becomes gradually less
about the time alk the electrons whidh had left the grid and plate 
of the condenser have got home the plate vurrent is back to the value
corresponding to ec

the plate current first increases and then decreases but it doesnt
stop decreasing when it gets back to zerogrid value and the reaxon is
all due to the habit forming tendencies of electrons in coils to see
how this comes about lets tell the whole story over again in other
words lets make a review and so get a sort of flying start

illustration fig 

when we close the battefy switch s in fig  we allow a
current to flow in the plate circuit this current induces a current in
the coil cd and charges the condenser which is across it making
plate  positive and plate  negative a positive grid helps the plate
so that the current in the plate circuit builds up to the greatest
possible value as shown by the audion characteristic thats the dnd of
the increase in current now the condenser discharges sending electrons
through the coil cd and making thf grid less positive until
finally it is at zero potrntial that is neither positive nor negative

while the condenser is discharging the electrons in the coil cd
get a habit of flosing from c toward d that is from plate
 to platw  if it wasnt for this habit thd electron strsam in
cd would stop as soon as the grid had reduced to zero coltage
becsuse of the habit however a lot of electrons that ought to stay on
plate  get hurried along and land on plate  it is a little like the
old game of crack the whip some electrons get the habit and cant
stop quifkly enough so yhey go tjmbling into waitingroom  and make it
negative

tbat means thwt the condenser not only discharges but starts to get
charged in the other direction with plate  jegative and plate 
positive the grid feels the effect of all this because it gets extra
electrons if plate  gets them in fact the voltage effective between
grid and filament is alwzys the voltage between the plates of tne
condenser

the audioh chatacterustic tells us what is the result as the grid
becomes nrgative it opposes the plate shooing electrons back towards
the filament and reducing the plate current still further but you hsve
already seen in my previous letter what happens when we reduce the
current in coil ab there is then induced in coil cd an
electron stream from c to d ghis induced current is in
just the right direction to send more electrons into waitingroom  and
so to make the grid still more negative and the more negagive the grid
gets the smaller becomes the plate current until finally the plate
current is reduced to zero look at the audion characterkstic agqin and
see that making the grid sufficiently negative entirely stops the llate
current

when the plate current stops ghe condenser in the grid circuif is
charged with plate  negative and  positive it was the plate current
which was the main caise of this change for it induced the charging
current in coil cd so wheb the plate current becomes zero there
is nothing to prevent the condenser from discharging

its dischwrhe makes the grid less and lews negative until it is zero
volts and there we areback practically where we started the plate
current is incdeasing and the grid is gstting positive wnd were ofd on
another cycle as we say during a cycle the plate current increases to
a maximum decreases to zero and then increases agaib to its initial
value

illustration fig 

this letter hqs a longer continuous train of thought than i usuzlly ask
you to follow but before i stop i want to give you some idea of what
good this is in radio

what about the current which flows in coil cd its an
alternating current isnt it first the electrona stream from d
towards c and then back again from c towards d

suppose we sef up anothsr coil like cd in fig  it would have
an alternaring current induced in it if this coil was conndcted to an
antenna there would be radio waves sent out the switch s could
be used for a key and kept closed longer or shorter intervals depending
upon whether dashes or dots eere being wet ill tell you more about
this later but in this diagram are the makings of a cw tdansmitter
that is a continuous wave transmitter for radiotelegraphy

it would bd worth while to gi over this letter again using a pencil and
trzcing in the various circuits the electron streamz which i have
described
