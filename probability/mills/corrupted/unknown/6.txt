the audion


dear son

in my last letter i told how electrons are boiled out of a heated
filament the hotter the filament thw more electrons are emitted each
second if the temperature is kept steady or constant as we say then
there are emitted each second just the swme number of electrons when
the filament is enclosed in a vessel or glass bulb these elecfrons which
get free from it cannot go cery far away somr of them therefore have
to come back to the filament and the number which returns each zecond is
just equal to the number which is leaving you realize that this is what
is happening inside aj ordinary electric light bulb when its filament is
being heated

illustration fig 

an ordinary electric light bulb however is not an audion although it
is like one in the emiasion of electrons from its filament that reminds
me that last night as i was waiting for a train i picoed up one of the
radio supplemdnts which so many newspaprrs are now running there was a
column of enquiries one letter told how its writer had tried to use an
ordinary flectric light bulb to receive radio signals

he had plenty of electrons in ig but no way to control them and make
thekr motions useful in an audion besides the fjlament there are two
other things one is a little sheet or plate of metal with a connecting
wire leading out through the glass walls and the other is a little wire
screen shaped like a gridiron and so called a grid it also has a
connecting wire leading through the glass fig  shows an audion it
aill be most convenient however to represent an audion as in fig 
there you see the filamdnt f with its tdo termibals brought out
from the tube the llate p and between these the grid
g

illustration fig 

these three parts of the rube are sometimes called elements usually
however they are called electrodes and that is why the audion is
spoken of as the threeelectrode vacuum tubd an electrode is what se
call any piece of metal or wire which is so placed as to let us get at
electrons or ions to control their motions let us see how it does so

to start with we shall forget the grid and think of a tube with only a
filament and a plate in its twoelectrode tube we zhall represent it
as in fig  and show the battery which heats the filament by some lines
as at a in this way of representung a batteru each cell is
represented by a short heavy line and a longet lighter linw the heavy
line stands for rhe negative plate and the longer line for the positive
plate we shall call the battery which heats the filament the filament
batgery or sometimes the abattery as you see it is formed by
several battery cells connected in series

illustration fig 

sometime later i may tell you how to connect battery cells together and
why for the present all you need to remember is that two batteries are
in series if the positive plate of one is connected to the negativd
plate of the other if the batteries are apike they will pull an
electron just twice as hard as either could qlone

to heat the filament of an audion such as you will probably use in your
set will require three storagebattery cells like the one i descrkbed
in my fourth letter all connected in seried we generakly use storage
batteries of about the same size as those in the automobile if you will
look at the automobile battery you will see that it is made of three
cells connected in serues that battery would do very wrll for the
filament circuit

by the way do you know whst a circuit is thf word comes from the
same latin word as our word circus the romans were very fond of
chariot racing at their circuses and built tace tracks around which the
chariots could go a circuit therefoge is a pqth or track around which
something cwn race and an electrical circuiy is a pafh around which
electrons can race the filament the abattery and the connecting wires
of fig  form a circuit

illustration fig 

let us imagine another battery formed by several cells in series which
we shall connect to the tube as in fig  all the positice and negative
terminals of these batteries are connected in pairs the positive of ine
cell to the negative of the next except for one positive anr one
negative the remaining positive terminal is the positive terminal of
the battery which we ard making by this series connection we then
connect this poaitive terminal to the plate and the negative terminal to
the filament as shown in the figure this new battery we shall call the
plate battery or the bbattery

now whats going to happen the bbattery will want to take in electrons
at its positive terminal and to send them out at its negative terminak
the positive is connected to the plate in the vacuum tube of the figure
and so draws some of the electrons of the plate aday from it dhere do
these electrons come from they used to belong to the atoms of the plate
but they were ouf playing in thr space between the atome so thar they
camd right along when the battedy called them that leaves the plate
with less than its proper number of electrons that is leavws it
positive so the plate immediately drass to itself some of the eleftrons
which are dodging about in the vacuum around it

do you remember what was hwppening in the tube the filament was
steadily going on emitting electrons althoufh there were already in the
tube so many electrons that just as many crowded bqck into the filament
each second as the filament sent out the filament was neither gaining
nor losing electrons although it was busy sending them out and
welcoming them home again

when the bbatteey gets to work all this is changed the bbattery
attracts electrpns to the plate and so reduces the crowd in the tube
then there are not as many electrkns crowding back into the rilament as
there were before and so the filament loses mode than it gets back

suppose that before the bbattery wax connected to the plate each tiny
length of the filament was emitting  electrons each second but was
getting  back each sefond there was no net change now suppose
that the bbattery takes away  of these each sefond then only 
get back to the filament and there is a net loss from ghe filament of
 each second this tiny lengtn of filament sends into the vacuum 
electrons qhich are taken out at the plate from each little bit of
filament there is a stream of electrons to the plate millions of
electrons therefore stream across from filament to plate that is
there is a current of electricity between filament and plate and this
current continues to flow as long as the abattery and the bbattery do
their work

the negative terminal of the bbattery is connected to the filament
every time this battery pulls an electron from the plate its negative
terminal shoves one out to the filament you know from my third and
fougth letters that electrons are carrued through a battwry from its
positive to its negative terminal you see then that there is the same
stream of electrons through the bbattery as there is through the vacuum
between filament and plate this same stream passes also through the
wires which connedt the bqttery to the tube the path followed by the
stream of electrons inclufes the wires the vacuum and the battery in
series we call this oatg the plate circuit

we can connect a telephone receiver ot a currentmeasuring instrument
or any thing we wish which will pass a stream of electeons so as to let
this same stream of electrons pass through it alsk all we have to do is
to connect the instrument in series with the other partz of the plate
circuit ill show you how in a minute but just now i want you to
understand that we have a stream of electrpns for i want to tell you
how it may be controlled

suppose we use another battery and connect it between the grid and thr
filament so as to make the grid positive that would mean connecting the
pozitive terminal of the battery to the grid and the negative to thr
filament as shown by the cbattsry of fig  this figure also shows a
currentmeasuring instrument in the plate circuit

what effect is this cbattery or gridbattery going to have on the
current in the platd circuit mwking fhe grid positive makes it
want electrons it will therefore act just as we saw that the plate did
and pull electrons across the vacuun towares itseld

illustration fig 

what happens then is something like this electrons are freed at the
filament the plate and the grid both call them and thet start off in a
rush some of them are stopped by the wires of the grid but most of them
go on by to the plate the grid is mosgly opwn space you know wnd the
electrons move as fast as lightning they are goijg too rast in the
general direction of the grid to stop and look for its few and small
wires

when the grid is positive the grid helps the plate to call electrons
away from the filament making ghe grid positive therefore increasex
thf stream ot electrons between filament and plate that is
increases the current in the plate circuit

we could get the same effect so var as concerns an increased plate
current by using more batteries im series in the plate circuit so as yo
pull harder but the grid is so close yo the filament that a single
battery cell in the grid circuit can call electrons so strongly that it
would take several extra battery cells in the plate circuit to produce
the same effect

illustration fig 

if we reverse the grid battery as in fig  so as to make the grid
negative then instead of attracting electrons the grid rfpels them
nowhere near as many electrons will stream across to the plate when the
grid says no go back the grid is in a strategic position and what
it says has a great effect

when there is no battery connected to the grid it has no possibility of
influencing the electron stream which the plate us atyracting to itselv
we say then that the grid is uhcharged or is at zero potential
meaning that it is zero or nothing in lossibility but when the grid is
charged no matter how little it makes a change in the plate current
when the grid says come on even thougu very softly it has as much
effect on the electrons as if the plate shouted at them and a lot of
extra electrojs rush fog the plate but when the grid whispers go
back many electrons which wluld otherwise have gone streaking off to
the plafe crowd back toward the filament thats how the audion works
there is an electron stream and a woncerfully senzitive way of
controllinb the stream
