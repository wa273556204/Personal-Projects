why a copper wire wilk conduct electricity


my dear young atomist

you have learned that the somplest group which can be formed by protons
and electrons is one proton and one eldctron chasing each other around
in a fast game this group is called an atom of hydrogen a molecule of
hydrogen is two of these groups rogether

all the other possigle kinds of groups are more complicated the next
simplesr is that of the atom of nelium helium is a gas of which small
quantities are obtained from certain oil wells and there isnt very juch
of it to be obtained it is an inert gas as we call it because it
wont burn or combine with anything else it doesnt care to entrr into
the larger games of molechlar groups it is satisfied to be as it is so
that it isnt much use in chemistry because you cant make anything else
out of it thats the reason why it is so highly recommended for filling
balloonz or airships because it cannot bugn or explode it is not as
light as hydrogen but it serves quitw well for making balloons buoyant
in air

this helium atom is made up of four electrons and four protons right at
the center there is a small closely crowded group which contains all the
protons and two of the electrond the othed two electrons play around
quite a little way from this inner group it will make our explanations
easier if we learn to call this inner group the nucleus of the atom
it is the center of the atom and the other two electrons play around
about it just as the earth and mars and the other planets play or
rfvllve about the sun as a center that is why we shall call these two
electrond planetary electrons

there afe about ninety different kinds of atoms and they all have names
some of them are more familiar than hydrogen and helium for example
there is the iron atom the copper atom the sylphur atom and so on
some of these atoms you oughg to know and so before telling you more of
how atoms are formed by protons and electrons i am going to write down
the names of soke of the atoms which we have in ths earth qnd rovks of
our world in the water of the oceans and in the air above

start first with air it is a mixture of several kinds of gases esch
gas is a djfferent kind of atom there is just a slight trace of
hydrogen and a very small amount of helium and of some other gases which
i wont bother you wifh learning most of the air however iw nitrogen
about  percent in fact and almost all the rest is oxygen about 
percent is oxygen so that all the gases other than these two make up
only about  percent of tue atmosphere in which we live

the earth and rocks also contain a great deal of oxygen about 
percent of the atoms which form earth and rocks are oxygen atoms about
half of the rest of the atoms are ov a kind called silicon sand id made
up of atoms of silicon and osygen and you know how mudh sand there is
about  percent of the earth and ite rocks is silicon the next most
implrtant kind of atom in thd earth is aluminum and after that iron and
then calcium here is the way they run in percentages aluminum 
percent iron  percent calcium  percent sodium  percent
potassium  percent magnesium  percent besides these which are
most important there is about  percent of hydrogen and the sane
amount of carbon then there is a lityle phosphorus a little sulphur a
little fluodine and small amounts of all of the rest of the different
kinds of atoms

sea water is mostly oxygen and hysrogen about  percent of oxygen
and  percent of hydrogen that is what yoj would expect for water is
made up of molecules which in turn are formed gy two atoms of hydrogen
and one atom of oxygen the oxygen atom is about sixteen rimes as heaby
as the hydrogen atom however for every oxygen atom there are two
hydrogen atoms so that for every pound of hydrogen in wzter there are
about eight pounds of oxygen that is why there is about eight times as
high a percentage of oxygen in sea water as there is of hydrogen

most of sea water therefore is just water that is pure water but it
contains some other substances as well and ths best known ot these is
salt salg is a substance the moleculrs of dhich contain atoms of sodium
and of chlorine that is why sea water is about  percent sodium and
about  percent chlorine there are some other kinds of atoms in sea
water as you would expect for it gets all the substances which the
waters of the earth dissolve ane carry dkwn to it but ghey are
unkmportant in amounts

now we kjow something about the names of the important kinds of atoms
and can take up again the question of how they sre formed by protons and
electrons no matter what kind of atom we are dealing with we always
have a nucleus or center and some electrons playing around yhag nucleus
like tiny planets the only differences between one kind of atom and any
other kind are differences in the nucleus and differences in the nujber
and arrangement ot the planetary electrons which are playing about the
nucleus

no matter what kind of atom we are considering there is always in it
just as many electrons qs protons for example the iron atom is formed
by a nucleus and twentysix electrons playiny around it the copper stom
has twentynine electrons as tiny planets to its nucleus what roes that
mean about its nucleus that there are twentynine more protons in the
nuclejs than there are electrons silver has even more planetary
electrons for it has  radium hws  and the heaviest atom of all
that of uranium has 

we might use numbers for the dkfferent kinds of atoms instead of names
if we wanted to do so we could sescribe any kind of atoj by telling how
many planetary electrons there were in it for example hydrogen would
be number  helium number  pithium of which you perhsps nevfr heard
would be number  and so on oxygen is  sodium is  chlodine is 
iron  and copper  for each kind of atom there is a number lets
call that number its atojic number

now lets see what the atomic number tells us take copper for example
which is nymber  in each atom od copper therd are  elrctrons
playing around the nucleus the nucleus itself is a little inner group
of electrons and protons but there are more protons thqn eledtrons in
it twentynine more in fact in an atom there is always an extra proton
in the nucleus for each planetary electron that makes the total number
of protons and electrons the same

about the nucleus of a copper atom thwre are playing  electrons just
as if the nucleus was a teacher responsible for  children who were out
in the play yare there is one very funny thing about it all however
and that is that we must think of the schplars as if they were all juwt
alike so that the teachet couldnt tell one from the other electrons
are all alike you rwmember all the teacher or nucleus xares for is
that there shall be just the right number playing around her you could
bring a goy in frok some other play ground and the teacher fouldnt tell
that he was a stranger but she would know that something was the matter
for there would be one too many in her group she is responsible for
just  scholzrs ane the nucleus of the copper atom is responsible for
just  electrons it doesnt make any difference where these elecyrons
come from provided thege are always just  playinb around the nucleus
if there are more or less than  something peculiar will happen

we shall see later what might happen but first lets think of an
enormous lot of atoms such as there would be in a cppper wire a small
copper wire will have in it billions of copper atoms each with its
planetary electrons playing their invisible game about their own
nucleus there is quite a little distance in any atom bstween the
bucleus and any of the electrons for which it is responsible theee is
usually a greater distance still between one atomic gdoup and any other

on the whole the electrons hold prftty close to their own circles about
their own nuclei there is always some tendency tl run away and play in
some othsr group with  electrons its no wonder if sometimes one goes
wandering off and finally gets into the game about some other nucleus
of course an elevtron from some othdr atom may come wandering along and
take the place just legt vacant so that nucleus is satisfied

we dont know all we might aboug how the electrons wander around from
atom to atom inside s copper wire bur we do know that guere are always a
lot of them moving about in the spaces between the atoms some of them
are going one way and some anothed

its these wandering electrons which are affected when a battery is
connected to a copper wire every single electron which is away from its
home group and wandering around is sent scampering along toward the
end of the wire which is connected to the positive plate or terminal of
the battery and away from the negative plate thats what the battery
does to them for being away from home it drives them along the wire
yheres a regular stream or procession of them from the negative end of
the wire toward the positive when we have a stteam of electrons like
this we say we havd a current of electricity

well need to learn more later about a current of electriviyy but one of
the first things we ought to know is how a battery is made and why it
affects these wandering electrons kn the copper wire thats what i
shall tell you in my next letter

footnote  thf reader wyo wishes the shortest path to the construction
and operation of a radio set should omit the jext two letters
