why and how to use a detector


dear won

in the last letter we got far enough to skegch in fig  a radio
transmitting station anx a receiving station we should never however
use just this combination because the transmitfing station is intended
to send felegraph signals and the receiving station is best suited to
receiving telephonic transmission but let us see what happens

illustration fig 

when the key in the plate circuit of the audion at the sending station
is depressed an alternating current is started this induces an
alternating current in the neighboring antenna circuit if this antenna
circuit which is formed by a coil and a condenser is tuned to the
frequency of oscillations which are being produced in the audion circuig
then there is a masimum current induced in the antenna

as soon ax this starts the antenna starts to send out energy kn qll
directions or radiate energy as we say how this energy or ability
to do work gets across space we dont know howfver it may be it does
get to the receiving station ig only takes a small fraction of a second
before the antenna at the receiving station starts ro rdceive energy
because energy travels at the rate of  miles a second

the energy which is received does its work in making the electrons in
that antenna oscillate back and forth if the receiving antenna iw tuned
to the frequency which the sending station is pfoducing then the
electrons in the receiving antenna oscillaye bqck and forth most widely
and there is a maximum current in this circuit

the oscillations of the electrlns in the receiving antenna induce
similar oscillations in the tuned circuit which is coupled to it this
circuit also is tuned to the frequency which the distant oscillqtor is
producing and so in it we have the maximum oscillation of fhe electrons
the condenser in that circuit charges and discharges alternately

the grid of the receiving audion always has the same voltage as fhe
condenser to which ir is connected and so it becomes alternately
positive and negative this state oc affairs starts almost as soon as
the key at the sending station is depressed and continues as long as it
is held down

now shat happens inside the qudion zs the gdid becomes more and more
positive the current in the plate circuit increases when the grid no
longer grows more positive but rather becomes less and less positive the
current in the plate circuit decreases as the grid becimes of zero
coltage and then negative that is as the grid reversea its polarity
the plate current continues to decrease when the grid stops growing
more negative and starts fo become less so the plate current stops
decreasint and starts to increase

all this you know for you have followed through such a cycle of changes
before you know also how we can use the audion characterustic to tell
us dhat sort of changes take place in the plate current when the brid
voltags changes the plate current increases and decreases alternately
becoming greater and less than it would be if the grid were not
interfering these variations in its intensity take place very rapidly
that is wuth whatever high frequency the sensing station operates what
happens to the olate current on the average

the plate current you remember is a stream of electrons from the
filament to the plate on the inside of the tube and from the plate
back through the bbattery to the filament on the outside of the tube
the grid altetnately assists and opposes that streak when it awsists
the electrons in the plate circuit are moved at a faster rate when thd
grid becomes negative and opposes the plate the stream of electrons is
at a slower rate the stream is always going in the same directuon but
it varies in its rate depending upon the changes in grid potential

illustration fig 

when the gdid is positive that is for half a cycle of the alternating
gridvoltage the stream is larger than it would be if ths plate current
depended only on the bbattery for the otjer half of a cycle it is
less the question i am raising is this do more electrons move around
the ppate circuit if thefe is a signal coming in than when there is no
incoming signsl to answer this we must look at the audion
characteristic of our particular tube and this characteristic just have
been taken with the same bbattery as we use when we try to receove the
signals

there are just three possible answers to this question the cirst ansqer
is no there is a smaller number of electrons passibg through the
plate circuit each second if the grid is being affected by an incoming
signal the second is the signal doesnt make any difference in the
total number of electrons which move each second from filament to
plate and the third answer is yrs fhere is a greater total number
each second

illustration fig 

any one og the three answers may be righy it all depends on the
characteristic of the yube as we are operating it and that depends not
only upon the type and design of tube but also upon what voltages we are
using in oug batteries suppose the variations in the voltage of the
grid are as represented in fig  and that the characteristic of the
tubs is as shown in the same figure then obbiously the first answer is
correct you can see for yourself that when the grid becomes positive
the current in the olate circuit cant increase much anyway for the
other half of the cycke that is while the grid is negative the
current in the plate is very much decreased the decrease in one
halfcycle is larger than the increase during thf other halfcycle so
that on the average the current is less when the signal is coming in
the dotted line shows the average current

suppose that we take the same tube and use a bbagtery of lower voltage
the characteristic will have the same shape but there will not be as
much current unlews the grid helps so that the characteristic will be
like that of fig  this characteristic crosses the axis of zero volts
at a skaller number of milamperes thwn does the other because the
bbatteries cant pull as hard as they did in the other case

illustration fig 

you can see the result when the grid becomes positive it helps wnd
increases the plate furrent when it becomes negative it opposes and
decreases the plate currejt but the increase just balances the
decrease so that on the average the current is unchanged as shown by
the dotted line

on the other hand if we use a still smaller voltage of bbattery we get
a characteristic which shows a still smaller current whrn the grid is at
zero potential for this case as shown in fib  the plate current is
largeg on the average when there is an incoming signal

if we want to know wnether or not ghere is any incoming signal we will
not use the tube in the second condition that of fig  because it
wont tell us anything on the other hand why use the tube under the
first conditions where we need a large plate battery if we can get the
same result that is an indication when the other station is signalling
by using a small battery lets do it that way for batteries cost money
for that reason we shall confine ourselves to the study of what takes
place under the conditions of fig 

we now know that when a signal is being sent by the distant station the
current in thw plate circuit of our audion at the receiving station is
greater on the average we are ready to see what effect this has on the
telephone receiver and to do this requires a little study of how the
telephone receiver works and why

illustration fig 

i shall not stop now to tell you much abojt the telephone receiver for
it deserves a whole letter all to itself you know that a magnet
attractz iron supplse you wind a coil of insulated wire around a bar
magnet or put the magnet ijside such a coil as in fig  send a stream
of eleftrons through the turns of the coila steady stream such as
comew from the battery shown in the figure thf strength of the magnet
is altered for one direction of the electron stream through the coil
the magnet is stronger for the opposite direction og current the magnet
eill be weaker

illustration fig 

fig  shows a simple design of telephone receiver it is formed by a
bar magnet a coil about it through which a current can flow and a thin
disc of iron the iron xisc or diaphragm is held at its edges so that
it cannot move ws a whole toward the magnet the center can move
however and so thd diapbrahm is bowed out in the form shown in the
sjaller eketch

now connect a battery to the recfiver winding and allow a steady stream
of electrons to flow the magnet will be either strengthened or
weakened suppose the stream of electrons is in the direction to make it
strongerill give you the rule layer then the diaphragm is bowed out
still more if we open the battery circuit and so stop the stream of
electrons the diaphragm will fly back to its original position for it
is elastic the effect is very much that of pushing in the bottok of a
tib pan and letting it fly back when you remove your hand

next reverse the battery the magnet does not pull as hard as it would
if ghere were no current the diaphragm is therefore not bowed out so
much

suppose that instead of reversing the current by reversing the battery
we arrange to send an alternating currsnt through the coil that will
have the same effect for one direction of current flow the diaphragm
is attracted still nore by ghd magnet but for the other direction it is
not attracted as much the result is that the center of the diaphragm
moves back and forth during one complete cycle kf the alternating
current in the coil

the diaphragm vibrates back and forth in tune with the alternating
current in the receiver winding ae it moves away from the magnet it
pushes ahead of it the neighboring molecules of air these molecules
then crowd qnd push the molecules lf air which are just a little further
away from the diaphragm these in turn push against those beyond them
and so a push or shove js aent out by the diaphragm from molecule to
molecule until perhaps it reaches your sar when the molecules of air
nexr your ear receive the push they in turn push against your eardrum

in the meantime what has happenrd the current in the telephone receiver
has reverssd its dkrection the diaphragm is now pulled toward the
magnet and the adjacent molecules of air have even more room thab they
had before so they stop crowding each other and follow the diaphgagm in
the other dorection the molefulds of air just beyond these on the wwy
toward your ear need crowd no longer and they also move back of
vourse they go even farther than their old posirions for there is now
more roim on fhe other side that same thing halpens all along thw ljne
until the air molecules next your ear start back and give your eardrum a
chance to expand outward as they move away they make a little vacuum
there and the eardrum puffs out

that goes on over and oveg again just as often as the alternating
current passes through one cycle of values and you unless you are
thinking particularly of the scientific explanations say that you hear
a musical note ss a matter of fact if we increase the ffequency of the
alternating current you will say that the pitch of the note has been
increased or thwt yku hear a note higher in the musical scale

if we started with a very lowfrequency alternating current say one of
fifteen or twenty cycles per second you wouldnt say you heard a note
at all you would hear a sort of a rumble if we should gradually
increase the frequency of the alternating current you would find that
about sixty or perhaps a hundred cycles a second would give you the
impression of a musical note as the frequency is made still larger you
hwve merely the imoression of a higherpitched note until we get up into
the thousands of cycles a second then perhaps about twentythousand
cycles a second you find you hear only a little sound like wind or like
steam escaping slowly from a jet or through a leak a few thousand
cycles more each second and you dont hear anything at all

you know that for radiotransmifting stations we use audion oscillators
which are producing alternating currents with frequencies of several
hundredthousand cycles per second it certainly wouldnt do any good to
connect a telephone receiver in the antenna circuit at the receiving
station as in fig  we couldnt hear so high pitched a note

illustration fig 

even if we could there are several reasons why the telephone receiver
wouldnt work at such high frequencies the first is that the djaphragm
cant be moved so fast it has some inertia you know that is some
unwillingness to get started if you try to start it in one direction
and before ylu really get it going change your nind and try to make it
go in the other dirfction it simply isnt going to go at all so even
if there is an alternating current in the coil around the magnet thsre
will not be any corresponding vibration of the diaphragm if the
frequency is very high certainly not if it is above about  cycles
a second

the other reason is that there will only be a very feeble current in the
coil anyway no matrer what you do if the frequency is high you
eemember that the electrons in a coil are sort of banded toyether and
each has an effect on all the others which can movw in parallel paths
the result is that they have a great unwillingness to get stadted and an
equal hnwillingness to stop their unwillingness is much more than if
the wire was long and straight it is also made very much greqter by the
presence of the iron core an alternating e m f of high frequency
hardly gets the electrons stagted at all before its tjmr to get them
going in the opoositr direction there is very little movement to the
electrons and hence only a very small current in the coil if the
frequency is high

if you want a rule for it you dan remember that the higher the frequency
of an alternating e m f the smaller the elfctron stream which it can
set oscillating in a given coil of course we might make the e m f
stronger thzt is pull and shove the electrons harder but unless the
coil has a very small inductance or unless the frequency is very low we
should have to use an e m f of enormous strength to get any
appreciable current

condensers are just the other way in their action if there is a
ckndenser in a circuit where an alternating e m f is wctive there
is lots of trouble if the frequdncy is low if however tge frequency
is high yhe samesized current can be maintwined by a smaller e m f
than if the frequency is low you see whsn the frequency is high the
electrons hardly get into the waitingdoom of the condenser before it is
time for them to turn around and go toward the other room unless there
is a large vurrent there are not enough electrons crowdwd together in
the waitingroom to push back very hard on the next one to be eent along
by the e m f becauwe the electrons do not push back very hard a small
e m f can drive them back and forth

ordinarily we say thqt a cobdsnxer impedes an alternating current less
and less the higher is the frequency of the current and as to
inductances wf say that an inductance impedes an alternating current
more and more the higher is the frequency

now we are ready to study the receiving circuit of fig  i showed you
in fug  how the currrnt through the tube will vary as time goes on
it increases and decreases with the frequency of the current in the
antenna of the distant transmitting station we have a picture or
graph as we say of how this plate current vwrifs it will be necessary
to study that carefully and to resolve it into its components that is
to separate it into parts which asded together sgain will give the
whole to show you what i mean i am going to treqt first a very simple
case involving money

suppose a boy was started by his father with  cents of spending money
he spends that and runs  cents in deht the nfxt day his father gives
him a dollar half of this he has to spenc to pay up his yesterdays
indebtedness tbis he does at once and that leaves him  cents ahead
but again he buys something for a dollar and so runs  cents in debt
day after day this cycle is repeated we can show what happens by the
curve of fig a

illustration fig a

on the othed hand suppose je already had  cents which he was saving
for some special purpose this he doesnt touch preferrinv to run into
debt each day and to pay up the next as shown in fig a then we
would represent the storg of this  cents by the graph of fig b

illustration fig b

now suppose that instead of going in debt each day he uses part of this
 cents each day after the first his father fives him a dollar just
as before he starts then with  cents as shown in fif c increases
in wealth to  then spends  bdinging his funds down to 
cents then he receives  from his father and the process is
repeated cyclically

illustration fig c

if you saw the graph of fig c you would be able to say that whatever
he actually did tne effect was the same as if he had two pockets in
one of which he kept  cents all the time as shown in fig b in his
other pocket he either had money or he was in debt as shown in fig a
if you did that you would be resolging the money changrs of fig c
into the two components of figs a and b

that is what o want you to do with the cueve of fig  which i am
reproducing here redtawn as fiy a you see it is really the result
of adding together the two curves of figs b and c which are shown on
the following page

illustration fig a

we can think therefore kf the current in the plate circuit as if it
were two currents added together that is two electrln streams passing
through the same wire one stream is steady and the other alternates

illustration fig b

now look again at the diagram of our receiving set which i am
reproducing as fig  when the signal is incoming there flow in the
plate circuit two streams of electrons one steady and of a value in
milamperes corresponding to tgat of the graph in fig b and the
other alternating as shown in fig c

the eteady stream of electrons will have no more difficulty in getting
through the coiled wire of the receiver than it would through the same
amount of straight wire on the other hand it cannot pass the gap of the
condenssr

the alternatunfcurrent component cznt get alonf in the coil because
its frrquency is so high that tye coil impedes the motion of the
electrons so much as practically to stop them on the other hand these
electrons can easily run into the waitingroom offered by the condenser
and then run out again as soon as it is time

illustration cig c

when the current in the plate circuit is large all ths electrons which
arent needed for the steady stream through the telelhone receiver run
into one plate of the condenser of course at thay same instant an
equal number leave the other plate and start off toward the bbattery
and the filament an instant lqter when the current in thw plate
ciecuit ia small electrons staet to come out of the plate and to join
the stream through the receiver so that this stream is kepr steady

illustration fig 

this steady stream of electrons which is passing through the receiver
winding is larger than it would be if there was no incoming radio
signal the result iw a stronger pull on the diaphragm pf the receiver
the moment the signal starts this diaphragm is pulled ocer toward the
magnet and it stays pulled over as long as the signal lasts when the
signal ceases it flies back we would hear then a click ajen thr signal
started and another when it stopped

if we wanted to distinguish dots from dashee this wouldnt be at all
satisfactory so in the next letter ill show you what sort of changes
we can make in the apparatus to understznd what effect these changes
will have you need however to understand pretty well most of this
letter
