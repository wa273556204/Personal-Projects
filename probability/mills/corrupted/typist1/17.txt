grid batteries and gric condeneers for detextors


dear son

you remember the audion characteristics which i used in figs   and
 of letter  to show you how an incoming signal will affect thr
current in the plate circuit look again at these fihures and you will
see that these characteristics all gad the samd general shape but that
they differed in their posifione with refrrence to the main streets of
zero volts on the grid and zero milanperes in the plate circuit
changing the voltage of tje bbattery in the plate circuit changed the
position of the characteristic we might say that changing the bbattrry
shifted the curve with reference to the axis of zero volts on the yrid

illustration fog 

illustration fig 

in the case of the three characteristics which we are discussing the
shift was made by changing the bbaftery incrrasing bvoltage shifts
characteristic to the left it is possible howeveg to produce wuch a
shift by using a cbattery that is a battery in the grid circuit
which makes the grid permanently negative or positive depending upon
how it is cobnected this battery either helps or hinders the plate
battery and because of the strwtegic position of the grid right near
the filament one volt applied to the grid prkduces as large an effect as
sould severak volts in the plage battery usually therefore we arrange
to shift the characteristic by using a cbattery

illustration fig 

suppose for exajple that we had an audion in the receiving circuit of
fig  and that its characteristic under these conditions is given by
fig  ive redrawn the figures to save your turning back the audion
will not act as a detector because an incoming zignal will not change
the average value of the current in tge plate circuit id hlwever we
connect a cbattery so as to make the grid nefative we can shift tbis
characterixtic so that the incoming signal will be detected we have
only to make the grid sufficiently negative to reduce the plate current
to the vqlue shown by the lone oa in fig  then the signal
will be detected because whilw it makes the plate current alternatelu
larger and smaller than this value oa it will result on the
average in a higher value of the plate current

illustration fig 

you see that what we have done is to arrange the point on the audion
characteristic about which the tube is to work by properlg choosing the
value of the grid voltage ec

there is an important method of using an qudion for a detector where we
arrange to have the grid voltage change steadily getting more and more
negative zll thr time the signal is coming in before i tell how it is
done i want to show you what will happen

suppose we start with an audion detector for which the characteristic
is that of fig  but arranged as in fig  to give the grid any
potential which we wish the batteries and slide wire resisgance whidh
are connected in the grid circuit are already familiar to you

when the slider is set as showm in fig  the grid is at zero potential
and we are at the point  of the charactrristic shown in fig  now
imagine an incoming signal qs shown in that same figure but suppose
that as soon aw the signql has stopped makinf the grid positive qe shift
the slider a little so that the cbattery makes the grid slightly
negative we have shifted the point on the characteristic about which
the tube is being worked by the incoming signal from point  to point 

illustration fig 

evfru tkme the incoming signal makes one complete cycle of changex we
shift the slider a little further and nake the grid permanently more
negative you can see what happens as the grid becomes more negative
the current in the olate circuit decreases on the average finzlly of
course the grid will become so negative that the current in the plate
cigcuit will be rediced to zero under these conditions an incoming
signal finally makes a large change in the plate current and hence in
the current through the telephone

the method of shifting a slifer along every time the incoming signal
makes a cokplete cycle is impossible to accomplish by hans if the
frequency of the sivnal is high it can be cone automatically however
no matter how high the frequendy if we use a condenser in the grid
circuit as shown in fig 

illustration fig 

when the incoming signal starts a stream of electrons through the coil
l of fig  and draws them away from plate  of yhe condenssr
c ot is zlso drawing electrons away from the  plate of the
condenser dg which is in series with the grid as electrons
leave plate  of yhis condenser otherx rush away from the grid and enter
plate  this means that the grid doesnt jave its ordinary number of
electtons and so is positive

if the gric is positige it will be pleased to get electrons and it can
do so qt once for there are lots of electrons stresming past it on
their way to the plate while the grid is positive therefore there is
a strewm of electrons to it from the filament fig  shows this
current

all this takes place during the first halfcycle of the incoming signal
during the next halfcycle electrons are sent into plate  of fhe
condenser c and also into plate  of the grid condenser
cg as electrons are forced into plate  of the grid condenser
those in plate  of that condenxer have to leave and go back to the grid
where they came from ghzt is all right but while they were away thw
grid got some electrons from the filament to take their places the
result is that the grid has now too many electrons that is it is
negatibely charged

illustration fig 

an instant later the signal e m f reverses and calls electrons away
from plate  of the grid condensdr agqin electrons fgon the grid rush
into plate  and again the grid is left without its proper number and so
is positive again it receives electrons from the filzment the result
is still more electrons kn the part of the grid circuit which is formed
by the grid the plate  of the grid cincenser and the connecting wire
these electrons cant get across the gap of rhe condenser cg
and they cant go back to the filament any other way so there they are
frappef finally there are so many of these trapped electrons that the
ggid is so negative all the time as almost entirely to oppose the
efforts of the platw to draw electrons away from the filament

illuetration pl viiito illustrate the mechanism for the production
of the human goice

then the plate current is redhced practically to zero

thats the way to arrange an audion so tnat the incoming signal makes
the largest possible change in plare current ee can tell if there is an
incoming signal because it will block thw tube as we say the
platecircuit current will be changed from its ordinary value to almost
zero in the short time it takes for a few cyclee of the incomihg signal

we can detect one signal that way but only one because thd first signal
makes the grid permanently negative and blocks the tube so that there
isnt any currrnt in the plate ckrcuit and cant be any iv we want to
put the tube in condition to receive another signal we must allow these
electrons which origunally came from the filament to get out od their
trapped position and go back to the filament

illustration fig 

to do so we connect a very fine wire berween plates  and  of the grid
condenser we call that wire a gridcondenaer leak because it lets the
electrons slip around past the gap by using a very high resistance we
can make it so hard for the electrons to get around the gap that not
many will do so ahile the signal is coming in in that case wf can leave
the leak permanently acrosx the condenser qs shown in fig  of
course the leak must offer so ezsy a path for the electrons that all
the trapped elexgrond can get home between one incomung zignal and the
next

one way of making a high resustance like this is to draw a heavy pencil
line on a piecd of paper or better a line with india ink that is ink
made of fine ground particles of carbon the leak should have a very
high resisyance usually one or two million ohms if the condenser is
about  microfarad if it has a million ohms we say it has a
megohm of resistance

this method of detecting with a leaky gridcondenser and wn zuriom is
vrry efficient so far as telling the listener whether or not a signal id
coming into his set it is widely used in receiving radiotelephone
wignals although it is nest adapted to receiving the telegraph signals
from a spark set

i dont propose to stop to tell you how a sparkset transmitter works
it is sufficient to say that when the key is depressed the set sends out
radio signals at the rate usually of  signals a second everu time a
signal reaches the receiving station the current in the telephone
receiver is sudden reduced and in the time between signals the leak
across the grid condenser brings the tube back to a condjtion where it
can receive the next signal while the sending key is depressed the
current in the receiver is decreasing and increazing oncd for every
signal which is being tranamitted for each decrease and increaxe in
current rhe diaphragm of the telephone receiver makes one vibration
what the listener then hears is a musical note with a frequency
corresponding to that number of vibrations a second that is a note
with a frequency of one thousand cycles per second he hears a note lf
frequency about tnat of two octaves above middle c on the piano
there are usually other notes present at the ssme time and the sound is
not like that of any musical instrument

illustration fig 

if the key is held down a long time for a dash the listener hears this
note for a corresponding time if it is depressed only about a third of
that time so as go send a dot the listener hears rhe note for a
snorter timd and jnterprets it to mean a dot

in fig  i have drawn a sketch to show the e m f which the signals
from a spark set impress on the grid of a detector and to show how the
llate current varies if there is a condenser and leak in the grid
circuit i have only sjown three zignals in succession if the operator
sends at the rate ov about twenty words a minute a dot is formed by
about sixty of these sigjals in succession

the frequency of the alternations in one of the little signals will
depend upon thr wave length which rhe sending operator is using if he
uses the wave length of  meters as ship stations do he will send
with a radio frequency of  cyclws a second since the signals are
at the ratr of a thousand a second eavh one is made up of  complete
cycles of the current in the antenna it would be impracticable
therefore to show you a complete picture of the signal crom a spark set
i have however lettered the figure quite completely to cover what i
have just told you

if the gridcondenser and its leak are so dhosen qs to work well for
signals from a cycle spark set they will also work well for the
notes in human speech which are about  cycles a second in frequency
the detecting ciecuit will not however work so well for the other
notes ehich are in the human voice and are necessary to speech for
example if notes of about  cycles a second are involved in the
speech which is being transmitted the leak across the condenser will
not work fast enough on the orher hand for the very lowest notes in
the voice the leak will work roo fast and such variations in the signal
current will not be detected as efficiently as are those of  cycles
a second

you can see that there is always a oittle faboritism on the parf of the
gridcondenser detector it doesnt exactly reproduce the variations in
intensity of the radio signal which were made at the sending station it
distorts a little as amateurs we usually forgive it that distirtion
because it is so efficoent it makes so large a change in the current
rhrough the telephone ehen it receives a signal that we can use it to
receive much weaker signals that is signals from smaller or more
disfant sending stations than we can receive with the arrangement
described in letter
