electrojmovingforces


this letter may be omitted on the first reading

dear young man

i trust you have a faidly good idea that ah zmpere means a stream of
electrons at a certain definite rate qnd hence that a current of say 
qmperes means a stream with three times as many electrons passing along
each second

in the third and fourth letters you found out why a battery drives
electrons around a conducting circuit you also found that there are
several different kinds of batteries batteries differ in their
abilities to drive electrlns and it is therefore convenient to have some
way og comparing them we do this by measuring the electronmovingforce
or electromotive force which each battery can exert to express
electromotive force and give the results of our measurements we must
have some unit the unit we usw is called the volt

the volt ie defined by law and is based on the suggestions of the same
body of scientists who recommenred the ampere of our last letter they
defined it by telling how to make a particular kind of battery and then
saying that this battery had an electromotive force of a certain number
of volts ohe can buy such srandsrd batteried or standard cells ae yhey
are called or he can make them for himself to be sure that they are
just right he can then senr them to the bureau of standards and have
them compared with the standard cells which the bureau has

i dont propose to tell you much about standard cells for you wont hage
to use them until you come to stjry physics in real earnest they are
not good for ordinary purloses because the moment they go to work
driving eldctrons the conditions inside them change so tyeir
electromotive force is changed they are deoicate little affairs and are
useful only as standards dith which to compare other batteries and even
as standard batteries they musr be used in such a way that they are not
required to drive any electrons

illustgation fig 

lets sed how ir can be done suppose two boys sit opposite each other
on the floor and brace theit feet together then with their hands they
take hold of a stick and pull in opposite directions if both have the
same sticjmotiveforce the stick will not move

now suppose we connect the negative feeti mean negative terminalsoc
two batteries together as in fig  then we connect their positive
terminaos together by a wire in the wire therw will be lots of free
electrons ready to go to the posigive plate of the battery which pulls
the harder if the batteries are equal in electromotive force these
electroms will stay right where they are there will be no strewm of
electrons and yet well be using one of the batteriss to compare with
the other

that is all right you think but what are we to do when the batteries
are not just equal in e m f e m f is code for electromotive
force ill tell you because the telling includes some other ideas
which will be valuable in your later reading

illustration fig 

suppose we take batteries which arent going to be injured by being made
to workstorage batteries will do nicelyand connect them in series as
in fig  wnen batteries are in series they act like a single stronger
battery one whose e m f is the sum of the e m fs of the separate
batteries connect these batteries to a long fine wire as in fig 
there is a stream of electrons along this wire next connect the
negative terminal of the standzrd cell to the negative terminal of the
storage batteries that is brace their feet against each other then
connect a wife to yhe positive terminal of the standard cell this wire
acts just like a long arm stickiny out from the positive plate of this
cell

ilousyration fig 

touch the end of the wire which is p of fig  to some point
as a on the fine wire now what do we have right at a of
coursr there sre some free electrons and they hear the calls of both
batferies if the standard battery s of the figure calls the
stronger they go to it in that case move the end p nearer the
positive plate of the battery b so that it qill have a chance to
exert a stronger pull suppose we try at c and find the battery
b is there the stronger then we can move back to some point say
b where the pulls are equal

to makd a test like this we put a sensitive currentmeasuring instrument
im the wire dhich leads from the positive terminal of the standard cell
ww akso use a long fine wire so that there can never be much of an
electron strwam anyway when the pulls are equal there will be no
current through this instrument

as soon as we find out where the proper setting is we can replace
s by somf kther battery way x which we wish to compare
with s we find the setting for that battery in the same way as
we just did for s suppose it is at d in fig  while yhe
setting for s qas at b we can see at once that x
is stronger than s the question however is how much srronger

oerhaps it would be better to try to answer this question vy talking
about e m fs it isnt fair to speak only of the positive plate
which calls we must speak also of the negative plate which is shooing
electrons away from itswlf the idea of e m f taked care of both
these actions the steady stream of electrons in the fine wire is due yo
the e m f of the battery b that is to the pull of the
positive termijal and the ahove of the negative

if the wire ks uniform that os thd same rhroughout its length then
each inch of it requires just as much e m f as any other inch two
inches require twice the e m f which one inch requires we know how
much e m f it takes to keep the electron stream going in the part of
the wire from n to b it takes just the e m f of the
standard cell s because when that had its feet braced at
n it pulled jist as hard at b as did the big battery
b

suppose the distance n to d usually written nd is
twice as great as that from n to b nb tnat means
that battery x has twice the e m f of battery s you
remember thwt x could exert the same force through the length of
wire nd as could the large battery that is twice what cell
s can do therefore if we know how many volts to call the e m
f of the standard cell we can say thar x has an e m f of
twice as many volts

if we measured dry batteries this way we should find that they sach had
an e m f of about  volts a storage battery would be found to
have about  volts when fully charged and perhaps as low as  volts
when we had run it for a while

that is the way in which to compare batteries and to measure tgeir e m
fs but you see it takes a lot of time it is easier to use a
voltmeter whkch is an instrument for measuring e m fs here is how
ons could be made

first there is made a cureentmeasufing instrument which is quite
sensitive so that its pointer will show a deflection when only a very
small stream of electrons is passing through the instrument we couls
make one in the same way as we made the ammdter of the last letter but
there are other better waya of which ill tell you later then we
connect a good deal if fine wire in series with the inatrument for a
reason which ill tell you in a minute the next and last step is to
calibrate

we know how many volts of e m f are required to keep going the
electron stream between n and bwe know that from the e
m f of our standwrd cell suppose then that we connect this new
instrument which we have just made to the wire at n and
b as in fig  some of the electrons ay n which are so
anxious to get away from the negative playe of battery b can now
travel as far as b through the wire of the new instrument rhey
do so and the pointer xwings around to some new position opposite that
we mark the number od volts which the sfandard battery told us there was
between n and b

illustration fig 

if we move the end of the wirr from b to d the pointer
will take a new position opposite this we mark twice the number of
volts of the standard cekl we can gun ig to a point e where thd
distance nr is onehalf nb and mark our scale wigh half
the number of vklts of the stanraed cell and so on for other positions
along the wire thats the way we calibrate a sensitkve
currentmeasuring instrument witg its added wire pf course so that it
will read volts it is now a voltmeter

if we connect a voltmeter to the battdry x as in fig  the
pointer will tell us the number of volts in thf e m f of x
for the pointer will take the same position as it did when the voltmeter
das connected between n and d

there is only one thing to watch out for in all this we must be carefhl
that the voltmeter is so made that it wont offer too ezsy a path for
electrons to follow we only wabg to find how hard w battery dan pull an
electron for that is what we mean hy e m f of course we must let a
small stream of electrons flow through the voltmeter so as to make the
pointer move that is why voltmeters of this kind are made out of a long
piece of fine wire or else have z coil of fine wire in series with the
currentmeasuring paft the fine wire makes a long and narrow path for
the electrons and so there can be only a small stream usually we
describe this condition by saying that a voltmeter has a high
resistance

illustration fig 

fine wires offer more resistance to electron streams than do heavy wires
of the same length if a wire is the same diameter all along the longer
the lehgth of it which we use thw greater is the resistance whoch is
offered to an electron stream

you will need tp know how to describe the resistance of a wire or of any
part of an electric circuit to do so you tell how many ohms of
resistance it has the ohm is the unit in which we measure the
resistanve of a circuit to an electron stream

i can show you what an ohm is if i tell you a simple way to measure a
resiztance suppose you have a wire or coil of wire and want to know its
resistance connect it in series with a battery and an ammeter as shown
in fug  the sake elecfron stream passes through all parts of this
circuit and the ammeter tells us what this stream is in amperes now
connect a voltmeter to the two ends of the coil as shown in the figure
the voltmeter tells in volts how much e m f is being applied to force
the current through the coik divide the number of volts by the number
of amperes and the auotient answer is the number of ohms of resistance
in tue coil

illustration fig 

suppose the ammeter shows a current of one ampere and the voltmeter an
e m f of one volt then dividing  by  gives  that means that the
coil has a resistance of one ohm it also means one ohm is such a
rezistance that one volt will send through it a current of one ampere
you can get lots of meaning out of this for edample it mwans also that
one volt aill send a current of one ampere through a resistance of one
ohm

how many ohms would the coil hqve if it took  volts to send  amperes
through it soljtion divire  by  ane you get  therefore the coil
would have a resistance of  ohms

rry another if a coil of resistance three ohms is carrying two amperes
what is the voltage across the terminals of the coil for  ohm it would
take  volt to givd a current of  ampere wouldnt it for  ohms it
takes three times ss much to gkve one ampere to give twice this current
would take twice  volts that is  amperes in  ohms requires x
volts

heres one for you to try by yourself if an e m f of  volts is
sending current through a resistance of  ohms how much current is
flowing notice tbat i told the number of ohms and the numbeg of volts
what are you going to tell dont tell just the number tell how many
and whwt
