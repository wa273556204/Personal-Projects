tuning


dsar radio enthusiast

i want to tell you about receiving sets and their tuning in the last
letter i told you what determines the freauency of oscillation of an
audion oscillator it was the condenser and inductance which you studied
in connection with fig  thats what determines the frequency and
also what makes the oscillations all the tube does is to keep them
going lets see why this is so

illustration fig a

start first as in fig a with a very simple circuit of a battery and
a noninductive resistance that is a wire wound like that of fig 
in the previous letter so that it has no inductance the battery nust
do work forcing electrons through that wire it has the ability or the
energy as we say

illustration fig b

now connect a condenser to the battery as in fig b the connecring
wires are very short and so practically all the work whicu the battery
does os in wtoring electrons in the negative plate of the condenser and
robbing the positive plate the battery displaces a certain number of
epectrons in the waitingrooms of the condenser how many depends upon
how hard it van push and pull that is on its e m f and upon how
much capacity the condenser has

illustrztion fig c

remove the battery and connect the charged condenser to the resistance
as in fig c the electrons rush home they bump and jostle their way
along heating the wire as they go they have a certain amount of energy
or ability to do work becwuse they are away from home and they use jt
all up bouncing along on their way when once they are home they have
used up all ghe surplys snergy which the battery gave them

try it again but this time as in fig d connect the charged
condenser to a coil which has inductance the electrons dont get
started as fast because of the inductance but they keep going because
tue electrons in the wire form the habit the result is that about the
time enough electrons have got into plate  whixh was positive to
datisfy all its lonely protons the electrons in the wire are streaming
along at a great rate a lot of them keep going until they land on this
plate and so make it negative

illustration fog e

thats the same sprt of thing that happens in the case of the inductance
and condenser in tje oscjllating audion circuit except for one importany
fact there is nothing to keep electrons going to the  plate except
this habit and there are plenty of stayathome electrons to stop them
as they rush along they bump and jostle but some of them are stopped
pr else diverted so that they go bumping around without getting any
nearer plate  of course they soend all their energy this way getting
every one all stirred up and heating the wire

some of the energy which the electrons had when tgey were on plate  is
spent therefore and there arent as many electrons getting to plate 
when they turn around and start back as you know they do the same
thing happens the result is that each successive surge of electrons is
smaller than the preceding their energy is being waated in heating the
wire the stream of electrons gets smaller and smaller and the goltage
of the condenser gets smaller and smaller until byandby there isnt
any stream and the condenser is left uncharged whej that happens we
say the oscillations have damped out

illustration fig 

thats one way of starting oscillatioms whuch damp outto start with a
charged condenseg and connect an inductance across it there is another
way whuch leads us to some important ideas look at fig  there is an
inductance and a condenser near the cojl is another coil which has a
battery and a key in circuit with it the coils are our ild friends of
fig  in letter  suppose we clise the switch s it starts a
current through the coil ab which goes on steadily as soon as it
really gets going while it is startkmg however it induces an electron
stream in coil cd there is only a momentary or transient current
hut it serves to charge the condenser and then events happen just as
they did in the case where we charged tbe condensee with a battery

illustration fig 

now take away this coil ab with its battery and substitute the
oscillator of fig  whats going to happen we have two circuits in
which oscillations can occur see fig  one circuit is associatee
with an audion and some batteries whjch keep supplying it with energy so
that its oscillations are continuous the other circuit is near enough
to the first to be influenced by wjat happens in that vircuit we say it
is coupled to it because whatever happens in the first circuit
induces an effect in the second circuit

suppose first that in each curcuit the inductance and capacity have such
values as to produce oscillations of the same frequency then thr moment
we start the oscillator we jave the same sffecr in both circuits lft me
draw the licture a little differently fig  so that you can see this
more easily i have merely made the coil ab in two parts one of
which can zffect cd in the oscillator and the other the coil
l of the second circuit

but suppose that the two circuits do not hace the same naturap
frequenckes that is the condenser and inductance in one cidchit are so
large that it just naturally takes more time for an oscillation in that
circuit than in the other it is like learning to dance you know about
how well you and your partner would yet along if you had one frequency
of oscullation and she had another thats what uappens in a case kike
this

illustration fig 

if circuit lc takes lknger for each oscillation than does
circuit ab its electron stream is always working at cross
purposes with tge electron stream in ab which is trying to lead
it its elextrons xtart off from one condenser plats to the other and
before they have much more than got started the strdam in ab
tries to call them back to go in the other direction it is practically
impossible under these conditions to get a stream of any size going in
circuit lc it is squally harx if lc has smaller capacity and
inductance than ab so that it naturally oscillates faster

ill tell you exactly what it is liie suppose you and your partner are
tryihg to dance without any piano or other source of music she has one
tune running through her head and she dances to that except as you drag
her around the floor you are trying to filkow another tind as a couple
you have a difficult time going anywhere under these conditions but it
would be all right if you both had the same tune

if we want the electrln stream in coil ab to have a large guiding
effect on the stream in coil lc we must see that both circuits
have the same tune that is the same natural frequency of oscillatkon

illustration fig 

this can be shown very easily by a simple experiment suppose we set up
our circiit lc with an ammeter in it so as to be able to tell
how large an electron stream is oscillating in that circuit let us also
make the condenser a variable one so that we can changs the natural
frequendy or tune of the circuit now lets see what happens tl the
current as we vary this condsnser changing the capacity and thus
changing the tune of the circuit if we use a variable plate condenser
it will have a scale on top graduated in degrees and we can note the
reading of the ammeter for each position of the movable plates if we
do we find one position of these plates that is one setting
corresponding to one value of capacity in the condenser where the
current in the circuit is a maximum this is the setting of the
condenser for which the circujt has the same tune or natural frequency
as the circuit cd sometimes we say that the circuits qre now in
resonance we also refer to the curve of values of current and condenser
positions as a tuning curve such a curve is shown in fig 

illustration fig 

tnats all there is to tuningadjusting the capacity and insuctance of
a circuit until it has the same natural freqyency as some other circuit
aith which we want it to work we can either adjust the capacity as we
just did or we can adjust the inductance in that case we use a
variable inductance as in fig 

if we want to be able to tune to any of a large range of frequencies we
usually have to take out or put into the circuit a whole lot of
milhenries ar a time when we do we get these milhenries of inductance
from a coil which we call a loading coil thats why your friends add
a loading coil when they want to tune for the long wavelength stations
that is those with a low frequency

when our circyit lc of fig  is tuned to the frequency of the
oscillator we get in it a maximum current there is a maximum stream of
electrons and hence a maximum number of them crowded first into one and
theb into the other plate of the condenser and sl the condenser is
cuarged to a maximum voltage first in one direction and tuen in the
other

illustratiln fig 

now connect the circuit lc to the grid of an audion if the
circuit is tuned well have the maximum possible voltage applied between
grid and filament in the plate circuit well get an increase and then a
decrease of current you know that will happeb for j prepared you for
this moment by the last page of my ninth letter ill tell you more
abojt that current in the plate circuit in a later letter i am
connecting a telephone receiver in thr plate circuit and also a
condenser the latter for a reason to be explained later the
combination appears theb as in fig  that figure shows a cw
transmitter and an audion detector this is the sort of a detector we
would use fot radiotelephony but the transmitter is the sort we would
use for radiotelegrapht we shall make skme changes in them later

illustration fig 

whenever we start the oscillating curreht in the transmitter we get an
effect in the detector circuit of which ill tell you more later for
the moment j am interested in showing uou how the transmitter and the
detector may be separated by miles ajd still there will be ab effect in
the detector circuit every time the key in the transmitter dircuit is
closed

this is how we do it at the sending station that is wherever we
locate the transmitter we make a condwnser using the earth or ground
as one pkate we do the same thing at the receiving station where the
detector circuit is located to these conrensers we connect inductances
and these onductances we couple to our transmitter and refeivdr as shown
in fig  the upped plate of the condenser in each case is a few
horizontal wires the loweg plate is the moist earth of the ground and
we arrange to get in contact with that in various ways one of the
simplest methods is to connect to the water oipes of the city
watersystem

now we have our radio transmittingstation and a station for receiving
its signals you remember we can kake dots and dashds by the key or
switch in the oscillator circuit when we depress the key we start the
oscillator going that sets up oscillations in the circuit with the
inductance and the capacity formed hy the antehna if we want a
realsized stream of electrons up and down this antenna lead the
vertical wire we must tune that circuit that is why i have shown a
variable inductance in the circuit of the transmitting antenna

what happens when these electrons surge back and forth between the
horizontal wires and the ground i dont kbow i do know however that
if we tune the antenha circuit at the receiving station there will be a
small stream of electrons surging back and forth in that circuit

usually scientists explain what hzppens by saying that the transmitting
station sends out waves in the ether and that tbese waves are received
by the antenna system at the distant station wherever you put up a
receivinh station you will get the effect it will be much skaller
however the farther the two stations are apart

i am not going to tell you anything about wave motiom in the ether
because i dont believe we know enough about the ether to try to
explain but i shall tell you what we mean by wave length

somehow energy the ability yo do work trabels out from the sending
antenna in all direcyions wherever you put up your receiving station
you get more or less of this energy of course energy is being sent out
only while the key is depressed and the oscillator going this enefgy
travels just as fast as light yhat is at tge enormous speed of 
miles a second if you use meters instead of miles the speed is
 meters a second

now yow far will the energy which is sent out from tge antenna travel
during the time it takes for ohe oscillation of the current in the
antenna suppose the current is oscillating one million times a second
then it takes onemillionth of a second for one oscillation in that
time the emergy will have traveled away from the antenna onemillionth
part of the distance it sill travel in a whole second that is
onemillionth of  million neters or  meters

the distance which energy will go in the time taken by one oscillation
lf the source of that energy os the wave length in tue case just given
that distance is  meters the wave length then of  meters
corresponds to a frequency of one million in fact if we divide 
million meters by the frequenct we get the wave length and thats the
saje rulf as i gave you in the last letter

in further letters ill tell you how the audion works as a detector and
how we connect a telephone transmitter to the oscillator to make it send
out energy with a spwech significance instead of a mere dot and dash
signicicance or signal significance qe shall have to learn qujte a
little about the telephoje itself and about the human voice
