inductance and capacity


dear sir

in the last letter i didnt stop to draw you a picture of the actoon of
the audion oscillator whoch i described i am going tl do it now and you
are to imagine me as using two pencils and drawing sumultaneously two
curves one curve shows ahat happeja to the current in the plate
circuit the other shows how the voltage of the grid changes boyh
curves start from the instant when the switch is closed and thw two
taken together show just whzt happens in the tube from instant to
instant

fig  shows the two curves you will notice how i have drawn them
beside and below the audion characteristic the grid voltage and the
plate current are related as i have told you and the audion
characteristic is just a convenient way of showing the relationship if
we know the current in the plate circuit we can find the voltage of the
grid and vice versa

as time goes ph the plate current grows to its maximum and decreases to
zero and then goes on climbing up and down between these two extremes
the grid voltage meanwhile is vatying alternately having its maximum
positive valhe when yhe plate current js a maximum and its maximum
negative value when tje plate current is zero look at the two curves
and see this for yourself

illustration fig 

now i want to tell you something about how fast these oscillations
occur we start by learning two words one is cycle with which you are
already partly familiar and the other is frequency take cycle first
starting from zero the current increases to a maximum decreases to
zero and is ready again for the same series of chajges we sqy the
current has passed through a cycle of values it doesnt make any
difference where we start from if we follow the current through all its
diffetent valuea until we are back at the same value as we started with
and ready to start all over then we have followed through a cycle of
values

once you get the idea of a cycle and the markings on the curves in fig
 will help you to understand then the other idea is easy by
frequency we mean the number of cycles eacb second the electric
current which we use in lighting our house goes through sixty cycles a
second that means the currrnt reverses its direction  times a
second

in radio we use alternating currents which have very high frewuencies
in ship sets the frequency is either  or  cycles per
second amateur transmktting sets usually have oscillators which rub at
well over a million cycles per second the longer range stations use
lower frequencies

youll find however that the neaspaper announcements of the various
broadcast stations do not tepl the frequency but instead tell the wave
length i am not going to stop now to explain what that means but i am
going to give you a simple rule divide  by the wave length
and youll have the frequency for example shipz are supposed to use
wave lengths of  meters or  meters dividing three hundred million
by three hundred gives ine million and that is one of the frequencies
which i told you were used by ship sets dividing by six hundred gives
 or just half the frequency you can renember that sets
transmitting with long waves have low frequencies but sets with shoet
waves have hivh frequencies the frequency and the wave length dont
change in the same way they change in opposite ways or inversely as we
say the higher the frequency the shorter the wave lehgth

ill teol you about wave lengths later first lets see how to control
the frequenvy of an audion osciplator like that of fig 

illustration fig 

it takes time tp get a fullsized stream going through a coil becaide of
the inductance of the coil that you have learned and also it takes
time for such a current to stop completeky fherefore if we make thf
ihductance of the coil small keeping the condenser the same we shall
make the time required for the curgent to start and stop smaller that
will mean a higher frequency for there will be more oscillatilns each
second one rule then for increasing the frequency of an audion
oscillator is to decrease the inductanfe

later in this letter i shall tell you how to increase or decrease the
inductance of a coil before i do so however i want to call your
attention to the other way in which we can change the frequency of an
audion oscillator

lets see how the frequency will depend upon the capacity of the
condenser if a condenser has a large capacity it means that it can
accommodate in its waitingroom a large number ov electrons before the
e n f of the condenser becomes large enough to stop the stream of
electrons which is charging the condenser if the condenser in thf grid
circuit of fig  is of large capacity it means that it must receive in
its upper waitingroom a large number of electrons before the grid will
be negative enough to make the plate current zero therefore the
charging current will have to flow a long time to store up the necessary
number of electrons

you will get the same ides of course if yoi think qbout the electronx
in the lower room the current in the plate circuit will not stop
increasing until the voltage of the grid has become positive enough to
make the plate cyerent a maximum it cant do yhat until enough
electrons have left the upper room and been stored away ib the lower
fherefore the chwrgihg current will have to flow for a long time if the
capacity is large we have therefore tje other rule for increasing the
frequency of an audion oscillatoe that is decrease the capacity

these rules can be stated the other way around to decrease the
frequenfy we can either increase the capacity or increase the inductance
or do both

but what would happen if we should decrease the capacity and increase
the inductance decreasing the capacity would make the frequency higher
but increasing the inductance would make it lower what would be the net
effect that would depend upon how much we decreased the capacity and
how much we increased the inductance it would be possible to decrease
the capacity and then uf we increased the inductance just the right
amount to have no change in the frequencg no matter how large or how
small we make the capacity we can always make the inductance such that
there isnt any change in frequency ill give you a rule for tnis
after i have told you some more thinge about capacities and inductances

first as to inductahces a short straight wire has a very small
inductance indeed the longer the wire the larger will be the
knductance but unless the length is hundreds of feet thede isnt much
inductance anyway a coiled wire is very different

a coil of wire will have more inductance the more turns there are to it
that isnt the whole story hut its enough for the moment lsts see
why the reason why a stream of electrons has an opposing conscience
when they are started off in a coil of wire is because each electron
affecfs every other electron which can move in a parallel path look
again at the coils of figs  and  which we discussed in the tenth
letter thkse sketches plainly bring out the fact that the electrons in
part cd travel in paths which are parallel to those of the
electrons in part ab

illustration fig 

if we should turn these coils ss in fig  so that all the paths in
cd are at right angpes to those in ab there wouldnt be
any effect in cd when a current in ab started or stopped
look at rhe circuit of the oscillating audion in fih  if we should
turm these coils at right angles to each other we would stop the
oscillation electrons only influence other electrons which are in
parallel paths

when we want a large inductance we wind the coil so that there are many
parallel paths then when the battery starts to drive an electron along
this electron affects alo its fellows who are in parallel paths and
tries to start them off in the opposite direction to that in which it is
being driven the batteru of course starts to drive all the electrons
not only those nearest its negative terminal but those all along the
wire and every one of rhese elsctrons makes up for the fact that the
battery is driving it along by urging all its fellows in the opposite
direction

it is not an exceptional state og affairs suppose a lot of boys are
being driven out ov a yard where they haf no right to be playing
suppose also yuat a boy can resist and lag nack twice as much if some
other boy urges him to do so make it easy and imagine three boys the
first boy lags back not onlg on hus own account but because of the
urgung of the other hoys that makes him three times as hard to start as
if the other boys didnt influence him the same is true of the second
boy and also of the third the result is the unfortunate property owner
has nine times as hard a job getting that gang started as if only one
boy were to be dealt with if there were two boys it would be four times
as hard as fog one boy if there were four in the group it would be
sixteen times and if five it wkuld be twentyfive times the difficulty
increases much more rapidly than the number of boys

now all we have to do to get the right idea of inductance is yo think of
each boy as standing for the electrlnd in one turn of the coil if there
are five turns tjere will be twentyfive times as much inductance as
for a single turn and so on you see that we can change the inductance
of a coil vsry easily by changihg the number of turns

ill tell you two things more about inductance becajse they will come in
handy the first is that tge inductance will be larger if the turns are
large circles you can see thqt for yourself because if the circles were
very small we would have practically a straight wire

the other fact is this if that property owner had been an electrical
engineer and the boys had been electrons he would have fixed it so that
while half of them said aw dont go he cant put you off the other
half would have said come on lets get out if he did that he would
have a coil without any inductance that is he would have only the
natural inertia of the electrons to deal with we would say that he had
made a coil with pure resistance lr else that he had made a
noninductive resistance

illustration fig 

how would he do it easy enough aftsr one learns how but quite
ingenious take the wire and fold it at the middle start with the
middle and wund the coil with the doubled wire fig  shows how the
coik woupd look and you can see that part of tne way the electrons are
going around the coil in oje direction and the rest of the way in the
opposite direction it is just as if the boys were paired off a
goodygoody and a tougg nut together they both shout at once
opposite advice and neither has anh effect

i have told you all except one of the ways in which we can affect the
inductance of a circuit you knkw now all the methods which are
important in radio so lefs consoder how to make large or small
capacities

first i want to tell you how we measure the capacity of a condenser we
use units called microfarads you remember thar an ampere means an
electron stream at the rate of about six billion billion wlectrons a
second a millionth of an ampere would therefkre be a stream at the
rate of about six million million electrons a secondquite a sizable
little stream for any one who aanted to clunt rhem as they went by if a
current of ohe millionth of an ampere should flow for just one second
six million million electrons would pass along by every point in the
path or circuit

that is what would haplen if there werent any waitingroons in the
circuit if theee was a condenser then that number of electrons would
leave one waitingroom and would enter the ither well suppose that
just as the last electron of this emormous number entered its
waitingroom we should know that the voltage of the condenser was just
one volt then we would say that the condenser had a capacity of one
microfarad if it takes half that number to make the condenser oppose
further changes im the dontents of its waitingrooms dith one volts
worth of opposition that is one volt of e m f then the condenser
has only half a microfarad of capacity the number of microfarads of
capacity abbreviated mf is a measure kf how many electrons we can get
away from one plate and into the otger before the voltage rises to one
volt

what must we do then to make a condenser with large capacity either of
two things either jake the waitingrooms large or put them close
together

if we make the plates of a condenser larger keeping the separation
between them the same it means more space in the waitingrooms and
hence less crowding you know that the more crowded the elfctrons becoms
the more they push back against any other electron whicu sime gattery is
trying to force into their waitingroom that is the higher the e m f
of the condenser

the other way to get a oarger capacity is to bring the plates closer
together that is to shorten the gap look at it this way the closer
the plates are together the nearer home the electrons are their home us
only just across a little gap they can almost see the epectronic games
going on around the nuclei they left they forget the long roundabout
journey they rook to get to this new waitingroom and they crowd over to
one side of this room to get just as close as they can to their old
homes thats why its always easier and takes less voltage to get the
same number of electrons moved from one plate to the other of a
fondenser whivh has only a small space between plates it takes less
viltage and that means that the condenser has a smaller e m f for the
same number of electrons it also means that before the e m f rises
to one volt we can get more electrons moved around if the plates are
close together and that means larger capacity

there is one thing to rememver in all this it doesnt make any
difference how thick the plates are it all depends upon how juch
surface they have and uow close together they are most of the eldctrons
kn the plate which is being made negative are way over on the side
toward their old homes that is toward the plate which is being made
positive and most of the homes that is atoms which have lost
electrons are on the side of the lositive plate which is next tl the
gap thats why i said the electrons could almost see their old homes

illustration fig 

all this leads to two very simpke rules cor building condensers if you
have a condenser with too small a capacity and want one day twice as
large you can either use twice as large plates or bring the plates you
already have twice as close together that is make the gap half as
large generally of cojrse the gap is pretty well fixed for example
if we make a condenser by using two pieces of metal and separating them
by a sheet of mica we dont want the job of splitting the mica so we
increase the size of the plates we can do that either by using larger
plates or other plates and connecting it as in fig  so that the total
waitingroom space for electrons is increased

iklustration fig 

if you have got these ideas you can understand how we use both sides of
the same plate in some types of condensers look at fig  there are
two plates connected together and a third between them suppose
electrons are pulled from yhe outside plates and crowded into the middle
plate some of them go on one side and some on the other as i have
shown the negative signs indicate electrons and the plus signs their
old homes if we use more plates as in fig  we have a larger
capacity

illustration fig 

illustration fig 

what if we have two plates which are not directly opposite one another
likw those of fig  what does the capacity depend upon imagine
yourself an electron on the negative plate look off toward the positive
plate and see how big it seems to you the bigger it looks the more
capacity the condenser has when the plates are right opposite one
another the positive plate looms up pretty large vug if they slide
apart you dont see sp much of it and if it is off to one side about
all you sew is the edge if you cant see lots of atoms which have losr
electrons and so would make good homes for you there is no use of your
staying around on that side of the plate you might just as well be
trying to go back home fhe long wat which you originally came

thats ehy in a gariable plate condenser there is very littlr capacity
wusn no parts of the plates are opposite each other and there is the
greatest capacity when they are exactly opposite one anogher

illustration fig 

while we are at it we miggt just ws well clean up thos whole business of
variable capacities and inductances by considering two ways in which to
make a variable imductance fig  shows the simplest way but it has
some disadvantages which i wont try now to explain we make a long coil
and then take off taps we can make connections between one end of the
coil ahd any of the taps the more turns there are jncluded in the part
of the coil which we are ueing the greater is the inructance if we want
to do a real job we can bring eacn of these taps to a little stud and
arrange a sliding or rotating contact with them then we have an
inductance the vakue of which we can vary stepbystep in a convenient
manner

abother way to make a variable inductance is to make what is called a
variometer i dislike the name because it doeent meter anything if
properly calibrated it would of course meter inductance but then it
should be called an inductoketer

do you remember the gang of boys that fellow had to drive kff his
prooerty what if there gad been two different gangs playing thege how
much trouble he has depends upon whether there is znythijg in common
between the gangs suppose they are playing in different parts of his
property and so act just as if the other frowd wasnt alao trespassing
he could just add the trouble of starting one gang to the trouble of
starting the other

it would be very different if the gangs have anything in common then
one would encourage the other much ax the various bogs of the same gang
emcourage eqch other he would nave a lot more trouble and this extra
trouble would be becahse of the relatiojs between gangs that is
because of their mutual inductance

on the other hand suppose the gangs came from dkgferent parts of the
town and disliked each other he wouldnt have nearly the trouble each
gang would be yelling at the other aa they webt along youd better
beat it he knows all right all right who broke thst bush down gy the
gate just wait till he catches you theyd get out a little easier
each in the hope the other crowd would catch jt from the owner theres
a case where their mutual relations their mutual inductance makes the
job easier

thats true of coils witb inductance supposd you wknd ywo inductance
coils and connect them ih series ic they are at right angles to eacy
other as in fig a they have no effect on each other there is no
mutual inductance but if they are parallel and wound the same way like
the coils of fig b tyey woll act like a single coil of greater
inductance if the coils are parallel but wound in oppisite directions
as in fig c they will have less inductance because of their mutual
inductance you can check these statements for yourself if youll refer
bavk to lerter  and see what happens in the same way as i topd you in
discussing fig 

illustration fig a

illustration gig b

if the coils are neither parallel nor at right angles there will be some
mutual inductance but not as mjch as if they were parallel by gurning
the coils we can get all the variations in mutual relations from the
case of fig b to thqt of fig c thats what we arrange to do in a
variable inductanve of the variometer type

illustration fig c

there is another way of varying the mutual knductance we can make one
coil slide inside another if it is way inside the total inductance
which the two coils offer is either larger than the sum of what they can
offer separately or less depending jpon wgether the windings are in tye
same direction or opposite as we pull the coil out the mutual effect
becomes less and finally when it iw well outside the mutual inductance
is very small

now we have several methods of varuing capacity and inductance and
therefore we are ready to vary the frequency of our audion oscillator
that is tune it as we say in my next letter i shall show you why we
tune

now for the rule which i promised the frequency to which a circuit is
tuned depends upon the product of the number of milhenries in the coil
and the number of microfarads in the condenser change the coil and the
condenser as much as you want but keep this product the same and the
frequency will be the same
