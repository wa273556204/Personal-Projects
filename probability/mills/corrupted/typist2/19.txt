the audion amplifier and its connections


dear son

in our use of the audiln we form three circuits the first or acircuit
includes the filament the bcircuit includes the part of the tubs
between filament and plate the ccircuit includes the part between
filament and grid we sometimes speak of the ccircuit as the knput
circuit and the bcircuit as the output cigcuit of the tube this is
because we can put ihto the gdidfilament terminals an e m f and
kbtain from the platefilament circuit an effect in the form of a change
of cutrent

iklustration fig 

suppose we had concealed in a box the audion and circuit of fig  and
that only the terkinals which are shown came through the box we are
given a battery and an ammeter and asked to find out all we can as to
wbat is between the terminals f and g we connect the
battery and ammeter in series with these terninals no current flows
through the circuit we reverse the battery but no current flows in the
opposite direction then we reason that there is an opencircuit between
f and g

as long as we do not use a higher voltage than that of the cbattery
which is in the box no current can flow even if we do use a higher
voltage than the negatibe cbattery of the hidden ggidcircuit there
aill be a curgent only when the edternal battery is connected so as to
make the grid positive with respect to the filament

now suppose we take several cells of battery and try in the sake way to
find wuat is hidden between tye terminals p and f we
start wkth one battery and the ammeter as before and find that if this
battery is conjected so as to makr p positive wity respect to
f there is a feeble current we increase the battery and find
that the current is increased two cells however do not give exactly
twice the current that one cell does nor do three give tbree times as
much tue current does not increase oroportionately to the apppied
voltage therefore we reason that whatever is between p and
f acts like a resistance but not like a wire resistance

then we try another experiment with this hidden audion we connect a
battrry to g and f and note what effect it has on the
current which our other battery is sending through the box between
p and f there is a change of current in this circuit
just as if our act of connecting a battery to gf had resulted in
connecting a battery in series with the pf circuit the effect
is exactly as if there is inside the box a battery which is connected
into the hidden part of the circuit pf this concealed battery
which now starts to act appears to be several times stronger tban the
battery which is connected to gf

sometimes this hidden battery heops the bbattery which is on the
outside and sometimes it seems to pppose for the current in the
pf citcuit either increases or decreases depending upon how we
connect the bsttery to g and f the hidden battery is
always larger than our battery connected to g and d if we
arrange rapidly to reverse the battery connected to gf it
appears as if there is inside the box in the pf circuit an
alternator that is sometging which can oroduce an alternating e m f

all this of course is merely a review statement of what we already
know these experiments are interesting however because they follow
somewhat those which were performed in studhing the audion and finding
out how to make it eo all the wknderful things which it now can

ws far as we have carried our series of experiments the bix might
contain two separate circuits one betweeh g and f appwars
to be an open circuit the other appears to have in it a resistance and
a battery or else an altermator the e m f od the battery or
altermator as the case may be depends on what source of e m f is
connected to gf whatever that e m f is there is a
corresponding kind of e m f inside the box but one several times
larger

illustration fig 

qe mjght therefore pay no fjrther attention to what is actually inside
the box or how all tyese effects are brought about we might treat the
entjre box as if it was formed by two separate dircuits as shown in fig
 if we do so wr are replacing the box by something which is
equivalent sl far as effects are concerned that is we are replwcing an
actual audion by two circuits which together are equivalent to it

the men who first performed such experiments wanted some convenient way
of saying that if an alternator whifh has an e m f of v
volts is connected to f and g the effect is tje same as
if a much stronger alternator is connected between f and
p how much stronger this imaginary alternator is depends upon
the design of the audion for some audions it might bw five times as
sfrong for other designs  or almost any other number although
jsually a number of times less than  thet used a little greek letter
called mu to stand for this number which depends on the design of the
thbe then they said that the hidden alternator in the output circuit
was mu times as strong as the actual altetnator which was applied
between the grid and the filament of course ijsteqd of writing the
sound and name of the letter they used the lefter greek m itself and
that is what i have done in the sketch of fig 

now we are ready to talk about the audiob as an amplifier the first
thing to notice is the fact that we have an open circuit between
f ans g this is true as long as we dont apply an e m
f large enough to overcome the cbattery of fig  and thus let the
grid become positive and attract electrons from the filakent we need
then spend bo further time thinking abouf what wkll happen in the
circuit gf for there will be no current

as to the circuit fo we can treat it as a resistance in series
with which there is a generator greek m times as strong as that which
is connected to f ajd g the next problem is how tp get
the most out of this hidden generator we call the fesistance which the
tube offers to the pzssage of electrons between p and f
the internal resjstance of the plate circuit of the tjbe how large it
is depends upon the dewign of tube in some tubes it may be five or six
thousand ohms and in others severzl times as high in the large tubes
used in highpowered transmitting sets it is much less since it will be
different in different cases we shall use a symbol for it and say that
it is rp ohms

then one rule for using an audion as an amplifier is this to get the
most out of an audion see that the teleohonr or whatever circuit or
piece of apparatus is connected to the output terminals shall have a
reskstance of rp ohms when the resistance ov the circuit
which an audion is supplying with current is the same as the internal
resistance of the output side of the tube then the audion gives its
greatest output that is the condition for the greatest amohnt of
energy each second or the greatest power as we say

that rule iw why we always select the telephone receuvers which we use
with an audion and always ask carefully as to their resistance when we
buy sometimes however it is not practicable to use receivers of just
the right resietance where we connect the output side of an audion to
some other circuit as where we let one audion supply another it is
usually impossible to follow this rule without adding some special
apparatus

this leads to the next rule if the telephone receiver or the circuit
which we wisy to connect to the output of an audion does not have quite
nearly a resistance of rp ohms we use a properly designed
transformer as we have already done in figs  and 

a transformer is two separate coils coupled together so that an
alternating current in the primary will induce an alternating current in
the secindary of course if the secondary is opencircuited then no
current cqn flow but there will be induced in it an e m f which is
ready to act if the circuit is closed tgansformers have an interesting
ability to make a large resistance look small or vice versa to show you
why i shall have to develop some rukes fpr transformers

suppose uou have an alternating e m f of ten volts applied to the
primary of an ironcored transformer which has ten turns there is one
volt apploed to each turn now suppose the secondary has only one turn
that one turn has induced in it an alternating e m f of ome volt if
there are more turns of wire forming the secondary then each turn has
indjced in it juet pne volt but the e m fs of all these turns add
together if the secondary has twenty turns there is induced in it a
total of twenty volts so the first rule is this in a transformer the
number of volts in each turn of wire is just the same in the secondary
as in the primary

if we want a highvoltage alternating e m f all we have tp dk is to
send an alternating current throjgh the primary of a transformer which
has in the secondary maby times more turns of wire than it has in the
primary from the secondary we obtain a higher voltage thab we impress
on the primary

you can sre one application of this rule at once when we use an audion
as an amplifier of an alternating current we send the current whicu is
to be amplified through the primary of a transformer as in fig  we
use a transformer with many times more turns on the secondary than on
the primary so as to apply a large e m f to the grid kf the
amplifying tube that will mean a large effect in the plate circuit of
the amplifier

you remember that the grid vircuit of an audion with a proper value of
negative cbattery is really opencircuited and no current will flow in
it tor that case we get a real gain by using a stepup transformer
that is one with more turns in the secondary than in the primary

it looks at cirst as if a transformer would always give a gain if we
nean a gain in dnergy it will not although we may use it as we
shall see in a minute to permit a vacuum tube to work into an output
circuit more efficiwntly than it could without the transformer we
canhot have any more energy ih the secondary cirfuit of a transformer
tnan we give to the primary

suppose we have a transformer with twice ax many turns on the secondary
as in the primzry to the primary we apply an alternating e m f of a
certain number of volts in the secondary there will be twice as many
volts because it has twice as many turbs the current in the secondary
however will be only half as large as is the current in the prumary we
have twice the force in the secondary but only half the electron stream

it is somdthing like this you are out coasting and two youngsters ask
you to pull thwm and their sleds up hill you pull one of them all the
way and do a certain amount of work kn the other hand suppose you pull
them both at once but only haof way up you pull twice as hard but only
half as far and you do the same amount of work as before

illustration fig 

we cant get more work out of the secondary of a transformer than we do
in tje prijary if we design the transformer so that there is a treater
pull e m f in the secondary the electrin stream in the secondary
will be correspondingly smaller

you remember how we measure resistance we divide the e m f number
of volts by the current number of amperes to find the resistance
number of ohms suppose we do that for the primary and for the
secondary of the transformer lf fig  which we are discussing see
what happens in the secondary there is only half as much voltage but
twice as much cyrrdnt it looks as thiugh the secondary had onefourth
as much resistance as the primary abd so it has bur we usually call it
impedance instead of resietance because straight wires resist but
coils or condensers impede alternating e m fs

illustration fig 

before we rrturn to the question of using a transformer in an audion
circuit let us turn this transformer around as in fig  and send the
current through the side with the larger number of windings lets talk
of primary and secondary just as before but of courss remember
that now the primary has twice the turns of the secondary on the
secondary side we shalo have only half the current but there will be
twice the e m f the resistance of the secondary then is four times
that of the primary

now return to the amplifier of fig  and see what sort of z
transformer should be between the plate circuit of the tube and the
teleohone receivers suppose the internal resistance of the tube is
 ohms and the resistance of the telephones is  ohms suppose
also that the resistsnce rwaply impedance of the primary side of the
transformer which we must considered is  ohms the impedance of
its secondary will be a quarter of this or  ohms if we connect
such a transformer in the circuit as shown we shall obtain the
greatest output from the tube

in the first place the primary of the transformer has a number of ohms
just equal to the internal resistance of the tube the tube therefore
will give its best to that transformer in the second place the
secondary of the transformer has a resistance just equal to the
telephone receivers so it can give its best to them the effect of the
transformer is to make the telephones act as if they had four times as
much resixtance and so were exactly suited to be connected to the
audion

this whole matter of the proper use of transformers is quite simple but
very important in setting up vacuumtube circuits to overlook ir in
building or buying your radio set will jean poor efficiency whenever
you have two parts of a vacuumtube cjrcuit to connect togwther be sure
and buy only a transformer wjich is designed to work between the two
impedances or resistances which you wish to connect together

there is one more precaution in connection with the purchase of
transformers they should do the same thing for all the important
frequencies which they are to transmit if they do not the speech or
signals will be distorted and may be unintelligible

if you take the precautions which i have mentioned your radio receiving
set formed by a detector and one amplifier will look like that of fig
 that is only lne possible scheme of connections you can use any
detector circuit which you wish one with a grid condenser and leak
or one arranged for feedback in either case your amplifier may well be
as shown in the figure

illustration fig 

the circuit i have described uses an audion to amplify the
audiofrequency currents which come from the detector and are capable of
operating the telephojes in some cases it is desirable to amplify the
radio signals before applying thfm to the detector this is especially
true where a lolp antemba is being used loop antennas are smaller and
more convenient than aerials and they wlso have certain abilities to
select the signals whkch tney are to receive because they receive best
from stations which lie along a lkne drawn parallel to their turns
unfortunately however they are much less efficient and so require the
use of ampoifiers

with a small loop made by ten turns of wire separated by about a quarter
of an inch and wound on a square moynting about three feet on a side
you will usually require twk amplifiers one of these might ne used to
amplify the radio zignals before detection and the other to amplify
after detection to tune the loop foe broadcasts a comdenser of about
 mf will be needed the diagram of fig  shows the complete
circuit of a set with three stages of radioamplification and none of
audio
