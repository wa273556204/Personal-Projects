how to measure an electron stream


this letter may be omitted on the first reading

dear youth

if we are to talk about the audion and how its grid controls the current
in the plate circuit we must know something of how to measure currents
an electric current is a stream of electrons we measure it by finding
the rate at which electrons are traveling along through the circuit

what do we mean by the word rate you know what it means when a
speedometer says twenty miles an hour if the car should keep going just
as it was doing at the instant you looked at the speedometer it would go
twenty miles in the next hour its rate is twenty miles an hour even
though it runs into a smash the next minute and never goes anywhere
again except to the junk heap

its the same when we talk of electric currents we say there is a
current of such and such a number of electrons a second going by each
point in the circuit we dont mean that the current isnt going to
change for it may get larger or smaller but we do mean that if the
stream of electrons keeps going just as it is there will be such and
such a number of electrons pass by in the next second

in most of the electrical circuits with which you will deal you will
find that electrons must be passing along in the circuit at a most
amazing rate if there is to be any appreciable effect when you turn on
the watt light at your desk you start them going through the filament
of the lamp at the rate of about two and a half billion billion each
second you have stood on the sidewalk in the city and watched the
people stream past you just suppose you could stand beside that narrow
little sidewalk which the filament offers to the electrons and count
them as they go by we dont try to count them although we do today
know about how many go by in a second if the current is steady

if some one asks you how old you are you dont say about five hundred
million seconds you tell him in years when some one asks how large a
current is flowing in a wire we dont tell him six billion billion
electrons each second we tell him one ampere just as we use years as
the units in which to count up time so we use amperes as the units in
which to count up streams of electrons when a wire is carrying a
current of one ampere the electrons are streaming through it at the rate
of about  a second

dont try to remember this number but do remember that an ampere is a
unit in which we measure currents just as a year is a unit in which we
measure time an ampere is a unit in which we measure streams of
electrons just as miles per hour is a unit in which we measure the
speed of trains or automobiles

if you wanted to find the weight of something you would take a scale and
weigh it wouldnt you you might take that spring balance which hangs
out in the kitchen but if the spring balance said the thing weighed
five pounds how would you know if it was right of course you might take
what ever it was down town and weigh it on some other scales but how
would you know those scales gave correct weight

the only way to find out would be to try the scales with weights which
you were sure were right and see if the readings on the scale correspond
to the known weights then you could trust it to tell you the weight of
something else thats the way scales are tested in fact thats the way
that the makers know how to mark them in the first place they put on
known weights and marked the lines and figures which you see what they
did was called calibrating the scale you could make a scale for
yourself if you wished but if it was to be reliable you would have to
find the places for the markings by applying known weights that is by
calibration

how would you know that the weights you used to calibrate your scale
were really what you thought them to be you would have to find some
place where they had a weight that everybody would agree was correct and
then compare your weight with that you might for example send your
pound weight to the bureau of standards in washington and for a small
payment have the bureau compare it with the pound which it keeps as a
standard

that is easy where one is interested in a pound but it is a little
different when one is interested in an ampere you cant make an ampere
out of a piece of platinum as you can a standard pound weight an ampere
is a stream of electrons at about the rate of six billion billion a
second no one could ever count anywhere near that many and yet
everybody who is concerned with electricity wants to be able to measure
currents in amperes how is it done

first there is made an instrument which will have something in it to
move when electrons are flowing through the instrument we want a meter
for the flow of electrons in the basement we have a meter for the flow
of gas and another for the flow of water each of these has some part
which will move when the water or the gas passes through but they are
both arranged with little gear wheels so as to keep track of all the
water or gas which has flowed through they wont tell the rate at which
the gas or water is flowing they are like the odometer on the car which
gives the trip mileage or the total mileage we want a meter like
the speedometer which will indicate at each instant just how fast the
electrons are streaming through it

there are several kinds of meters but i shall not try to tell you now of
more than one the simplest to understand is called a hotwire meter
you already know that an electron stream heats a wire suppose a piece
of fine wire is fastened at the two ends and that there are binding
posts also fastened to these ends of the wire so that the wire may be
made part of the circuit where we want to know the electron stream then
the same stream of electrons will flow through the fine wire as through
the other parts of the circuit because the wire is fine it acts like a
very narrow sidewalk for the stream of electrons and they have to bump
and jostle pretty hard to get through thats why the wire gets heated

you know that a heated wire expands this wire expands it grows longer
and because it is held firmly at the ends it must bow out at the center
the bigger the rate of flow of electrons the hotter it gets and the
hotter it gets the more it bows out at the center we might fasten one
endthe short endof a little lever a small motion of this short end
of the lever will mean a large motion of the other end just like a
teeter board when one end is longer than the other the child on the
long end travels further than the child on the short end the lever
magnifies the motion of the center of the hot wire part of our meter so
that we can see it easier

illustration fig 

there are several ways to make such a meter the one shown in fig  is
as easy to understand as any we shape the long end of the lever like a
pointer then the hotter the wire the farther the pointer moves

if we could put this meter in an electric circuit where we knew one
ampere was flowing we could put a numeral  opposite where the pointer
stood then if we could increase the current until there were two
amperes flowing through the meter we could mark that position of the
pointer  and so on thats the way we would calibrate the meter
after we had done so we would call it an ammeter because it measures
amperes years ago people would have called it an amperemeter but no
one who is uptodate would call it so today

illustration fig 

if we had a very carefully made ammeter we would send it to the bureau
of standards to be calibrated at the bureau they have a number of
meters which they know are correct in their readings they would put one
of their meters and ours into the same circuit so that both carry the
same stream of electrons as in fig  then whatever the reading was on
their meter could be marked opposite the pointer on ours

now i want to tell you how the physicists at the bureau know what is an
ampere several years ago there was a meeting or congress of physicists
and electrical engineers from all over the world who discussed what they
thought should be the unit in which to measure current they decided
just what they would call an ampere and then all the countries from
which they came passed laws saying that an ampere should be what these
scientists had recommended today therefore an ampere is defined by
law

to tell when an ampere of current is flowing requires the use of two
silver plates and a solution of silver nitrate silver nitrate has
molecules made up of one atom of silver combined with a group of atoms
called nitrate you remember that the molecule of copper sulphate
discussed in our third letter was formed by a copper atom and a group
called sulphate nitrate is another group something like sulphate for it
has oxygen atoms in it but it has three instead of four and instead of
a sulphur atom there is an atom of nitrogen

when silver nitrate molecules go into solution they break up into ions
just as copper sulphate does one ion is a silver atom which has lost
one electron this electron was stolen from it by the nitrate part of
the molecule when they dissociated the nitrate ion therefore is
formed by a nitrogen atom three oxygen atoms and one extra electron

if we put two plates of silver into such a solution nothing will happen
until we connect a battery to the plates then the battery takes
electrons away from one plate and gives electrons to the other some of
the atoms in the plate which the battery is robbing of electrons are
just like the silver ions which are moving around in the solution
thats why they can go out into the solution and play with the nitrate
ions each of which has an extra electron which it stole from some silver
atom but the moment silver ions leave their plate we have more silver
ions in the solution than we do sulphate ions

the only thing that can happen is for some of the silver ions to get out
of the solution they arent going back to the positive silver plate
from which they just came they go on toward the negative plate where
the battery is sending an electron for every one which it takes away
from the positive plate there start off towards the negative plate not
only the ions which just came from the positive plate but all the ions
that are in the solution the first one to arrive gets an electron but
it cant take it away from the silver plate and why should it as soon
as it has got this electron it is again a normal silver atom so it
stays with the other atoms in the silver plate thats what happens
right along for every atom which is lost from the positive plate there
is one added to the negative plate the silver of the positive plate
gradually wastes away and the negative plate gradually gets an extra
coating of silver

every time the battery takes an electron away from the positive plate
and gives it to the negative plate there is added to the negative plate
an atom of silver if the negative plate is weighed before the battery
is connected and again after the battery is disconnected we can tell how
much silver has been added to it suppose the current has been perfectly
steady that is the same number of electrons streaming through the
circuit each second then if we know how long the current has been
running we can tell how much silver has been deposited each second

the law says that if silver is being deposited at the rate of 
gram each second then the current is one ampere thats a small amount
of silver only about a thousandth part of a gram and you know that it
takes  grams to make an ounce its a very small amount of silver
but its an enormous number of atoms how many six billion billion of
course for there is deposited one atom for each electron in the stream

in my next letter ill tell you how we measure the pull which batteries
can give to electrons and then we shall be ready to go on with more
about the audion
