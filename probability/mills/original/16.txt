the human voice


dear sir

the radiotelephone does not transmit the human voice it reproduces
near the ears of the listener similar motions of the air molecules and
hence causes in the ears of the listener the same sensations of sound as
if he were listening directly to the speaker this reproduction takes
place almost instantaneously so great is the speed with which the
electrical effects travel outward from the sending antenna if you wish
to understand radiotelephony you must know something of the mechanism
by which the voice is produced and something of the peculiar or
characteristic properties of voice sounds

illustration fig 

the human voice is produced by a sort of organ pipe imagine a long pipe
connected at one end to a pair of firebellows and closed at the other
end by two stretched sheets of rubber fig  is a sketch of what i
mean corresponding to the bellows there is the human diaphragm the
muscular membrane separating the thorax and abdomen which expands or
contracts as one breathes corresponding to the pipe is the windpipe
corresponding to the two stretched pieces of rubber are the vocal cords
l and r shown in cross section in fig  they are part of the larynx
and do not show in fig  pl viii which shows the wind pipe and an
outside view of the larynx

illustration fig 

when the sides of the bellows are squeezed together the air molecules
within are crowded closer together and the air is compressed the
greater the compression the greater of course is the pressure with
which the enclosed air seeks to escape that it can do only by lifting
up that is by blowing out the two elastic strips which close the end
of the pipe

the air pressure therefore rises until it is sufficient to push aside
the elastic membranes or vocal cords and thus to permit some of the air
to escape it doesnt force the membranes far apart just enough to let
some air out but the moment some air has escaped there isnt so much
inside and the pressure is reduced just as in the case of an automobile
tire from which you let the air escape what is the result the
membranes fly back again and close the opening of the pipe what got
out then was just a little puff of air

the bellows are working all the while however and so the space
available for the remaining air soon again becomes so crowded with air
molecules that the pressure is again sufficient to open the membranes
another puff of air escapes

this happens over and over again while one is speaking or singing
hundreds of times a second the vocal cords vibrate back and forth the
frequency with which they do so determines the note or pitch of the
speakers voice

what determines the significance of the sounds which he utters this is
a most interesting question and one deserving of much more time than i
propose to devote to it to give you enough of an answer for your study
of radiotelephony i am going to tell you first about vibrating strings
for they are easier to picture than membranes like the vocal cords

suppose you have a stretched string a piece of rubber band or a wire
will do you pluck it that is pull it to one side when you let go it
flies back because it has inertia it doesnt stop when it gets to
its old position but goes on through until it bows out almost as far on
the other side

illustration pl viiphotographs of vibrating strings

it took some work to pluck this string not much perhaps but all the
work which you did in deforming it goes to the string and becomes its
energy its ability to do work this work it does in pushing the air
molecules ahead of it as it vibrates in this way it uses up its energy
and so finally comes again to rest its vibrations damp out as we
say that is die down each swing carries it a smaller distance away
from its original position we say that the amplitude meaning the
size of its vibration decreases the frequency does not it takes just
as long for a smallsized vibration as for the larger of course for
the vibration of large amplitude the string must move faster but it has
to move farther so that the time required for a vibration is not
changed

first the string crowds against each other the air molecules which are
in its way and so leads to crowding further away just as fast as these
molecules can pass along the shove they are receiving that takes place
at the rate of about  feet a second when the string swings back it
pushes away the molecules which are behind it and so lets those that
were being crowded follow it you know that they will air molecules
will always go where there is the least crowding following the shove
therefore there is a chance for the molecules to move back and even to
occupy more room than they had originally

the news of this travels out from the string just as fast as did the
news of the crowding as fast as molecules are able they move back and
so make more room for their neighbors who are farther away and these in
turn move back

do you want a picture of it imagine a great crowd of people and at the
center some one with authority the crowd is the molecules of air and
the one with authority is one of the molecules of the string which has
energy whatever this molecule of the string says is repeated by each
member of the crowd to his neighbor next farther away first the string
says go back and each molecule acts as soon as he gets the word and
then the string says come on and each molecule of air obeys as soon
as the command reaches him over and over this happens as many times a
second as the string makes complete vibrations

illustration fig 

if we should make a picture of the various positions of one of these air
molecules much as we pictured brownie in letter  it would appear as
in fig a where the central line represents the ordinary position of
the molecule

thats exactly the picture also of the successive positions of an
electron in a circuit which is carrying an alternating current first
it moves in one direction along the wire and then back in the opposite
direction the electron next to it does the same thing almost
immediately for it does not take anywhere near as long for such an
effect to pass through a crowd of electrons if we make the string
vibrate twice as fast that is have twice the frequency the story of
an adjacent particle of air will be as in fig b unless we tighten
the string however we cant make it vibrate as a whole and do it twice
as fast we can make it vibrate in two parts or even in more parts as
shown in fig  of pl vii when it vibrates as a whole its frequency
is the lowest possible the fundamental frequency as we say when it
vibrates in two parts each part of the string makes twice as many
vibrations each second so do the adjacent molecules of air and so does
the eardrum of a listener

the result is that the listener hears a note of twice the frequency that
he did when the string was vibrating as a whole he says he hears the
octave of the note he heard first if the string vibrates in three
parts and gives a note of three times the frequency the listener hears a
note two octaves above the fundamental note of which the string is
capable

it is entirely possible however for a string to vibrate simultaneously
in a number of ways and so to give not only its fundamental note but
several others at the same time the photographs of fig  of pl
vii illustrate this possibility

what happens then to the molecules of air which are adjacent to the
vibrating string they must perform quite complex vibrations for they
are called upon to move back and forth just as if there were several
strings all trying to push them with different frequencies of vibration
look again at the pictures of fig  and see that each might just as
well be the picture of several strings placed close together each
vibrating in a different way each of the strings has a different
frequency of vibration and a different maximum amplitude that is
greatest size of swing away from its straight position

illustration fig 

suppose instead of a single string acting upon the adjacent molecules we
had three strings suppose the first would make a nearby molecule move
as in fig a the second as in fig b and the third as in fig c
it is quite evident that the molecule can satisfy all three if it will
vibrate as in fig d

now take it the other way around suppose we had a picture of the motion
of a molecule and that it was not simple like those shown in fig  but
was complex like that of fig d we could say that this complex motion
was made up of three parts that is had three component simple motions
each represented by one of the three other graphs of fig  that means
we can resolve any complex vibratory motion into component motions which
are simple

it means more than that it means that the vibrating string which makes
the neighboring molecules of air behave as shown in fig d is really
acting like three strings and is producing simultaneously three pure
musical notes

now suppose we had two different strings say a piano string in the
piano and a violin string on its proper mounting suppose we played both
instruments and some musician told us they were in tune what would he
mean he would mean that both strings vibrated with the same fundamental
frequency

they differ however in the other notes which they produce at the same
time that they produce their fundamental notes that is they differ in
the frequencies and amplitudes of these other component vibrations or
overtones which are going on at the same time as their fundamental
vibrations it is this difference which lets us tell at once which
instrument is being played

that brings us to the main idea about musical sounds and about human
speech the pitch of any complex sound is the pitch of its fundamental
or lowest sound but the character of the complex sound depends upon all
the overtones or harmonics which are being produced and upon their
relative frequencies and amplitudes

illustration fig 

the organ pipe which ends in the larynx produces a very complex sound i
cant show you how complex but ill show you in fig  the complicated
motion of an air molecule which is vibrating as the result of being near
an organ pipe organ pipes differthis is only one case you can see
that there are a large number of pure notes of various intensities that
is strengths which go to make up the sound which a listener to this
organ pipe would hear the note from the human pipe is much more
complex

when one speaks there are little puffs of air escaping from his larynx
the vocal cords vibrate as i explained and the molecules of air near
the larynx are set into very complex vibrations these transmit their
vibrations to other molecules until those in the mouth are reached in
the mouth however something very important happens

did you ever sing or howl down a rain barrel or into a long pipe or
hallway and hear the sound it sounds just about the same no matter who
does it the reason is that the long column of air in the pipe or barrel
is set into vibration and vibrates according to its own ideas of how
fast to do it it has a natural frequency of its own if in your voice
there is a note of just that frequency it will respond beautifully in
fact it resonates or sings back when it hears this note

the net result is that it emphasizes this note so much that you dont
hear any of the other component notes of your voiceall you hear is the
rain barrel we say it reinforces one of the component notes of your
voice and makes it louder

that same thing happens in the mouth cavity of a speaker the size and
shape of the column of air in the mouth can be varied by the tongue and
lip positions and so there are many different possibilities of
resonance depending on lip and tongue different frequencies of the
complex sound which comes from the larynx are reinforced you can see
that for yourself from fig  which shows the tongue positions for
three different vowel sounds you can see also from fig  which shows
the mouth positions for the different vowels how the size and shape of
the mouth cavity is changed to give different sounds these figures are
in pl viii

the pitch of the note need not change as every singer knows you can try
that also for yourself by singing the vowel sound of ahh and then
changing the shape of your mouth so as to give the sound
ahawowou the pitch of the note will not change because the
fundamental stays the same the speech significance of the sound
however changes completely because the mouth cavity resonates to
different ones of the higher notes which come from the larynx along with
the fundamental note

now you can see what is necessary for telephonic transmission each and
every component note which enters into human speech must be transmitted
and accurately reproduced by the receiver more than that all the
proportions must be kept just the same as in the original spoken sound
we usually say that there must be reproduced in the air at the receiver
exactly the same wave form as is present in the air at the
transmitter if that isnt done the speech wont be natural and one
cannot recognize voices although he may understand pretty well if there
is too much distortion of the wave form that is if the relative
intensities of the component notes of the voice are too much altered
then there may even be a loss of intelligibility so that the listener
cannot understand what is being said

what particular notes are in the human voice depends partly on the
person who is speaking you know that the fundamental of a bass voice is
lower than that of a soprano besides the fundamental however there
are a lot of higher notes always present this is particularly true when
the spoken sound is a consonant like s or f or v the particular
notes which are present and are important depend upon what sound one
is saying

usually however we find that if we can transmit and reproduce exactly
all the notes which lie between a frequency of about  cycles a second
and one of about  cycles a second the reproduced speech will be
quite natural and very intelligible for singing and for transmitting
instrumental music it is necessary to transmit and reproduce still
higher notes

what you will have to look out for therefore in a receiving set is
that it does not cut out some of the high notes which are necessary to
give the sound its naturalness you will also have to make sure that
your apparatus does not distort that is does not receive and reproduce
some notes or voice frequencies more efficiently than it does some
others which are equally necessary for that reason when you buy a
transformer or a telephone receiver it is well to ask for a
characteristic curve of the apparatus which will show how the action
varies as the frequency of the current is varied the action or response
should of course be practically the same at all the frequencies within
the necessary part of the voice range
