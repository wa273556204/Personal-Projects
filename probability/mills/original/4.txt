the batteries in your radio set


this letter may be omitted on the first reading

my dear young man

you will need several batteries when you come to set up your radio
receiver but you wont use such clumsy affairs as the gravity cell which
i described in my last letter some of your batteries will be dry
batteries of the size used in pocket flash lights

these are not really dry for between the plates they are filled with a
moist paste which is then sealed in with wax to keep it from drying out
or from spilling instead of zinc and copper these batteries use zinc
and carbon no glass jar is needed for the zinc is formed into a jar
shape in this is placed the paste and in the center of the paste a rod
or bar of carbon the paste doesnt contain sulphuric acid but instead
has in it a stuff called sal ammoniac that is ammonium chloride

the battery however acts very much like the one i described in my last
letter ions of zinc leave the zinc and wander into the moist paste
these ions are positive just as in the case of the gravity battery the
result is that the electrons which used to associate with a zinc ion to
form a zinc atom are left in the zinc plate that makes the zinc
negative for it has more electrons than protons the zinc ions take the
place of the positive ions which are already in the paste the positive
ions which originally belonged with the paste therefore move along to
the carbon rod and there get some electrons taking electrons away from
the carbon leaves it with too many protons that is leaves it positive
in the little flash light batteries therefore you will always find
that the round carbon rod which sticks out of the center is positive
and the zinc casing is negative

the trouble with the battery like the one i used to make is that the
zinc plate wastes away every time a zinc ion leaves it that means that
the greater part of an atom is gone then when the two electrons which
were left behind get a chance to start along a copper wire toward the
positive plate of the battery there goes the rest of the atom after a
while there is no more zinc plate it is easy to see what has happened
all the zinc has gone into solution or been eaten away as most people
say dry batteries however dont stop working because the zinc gets
used up but because the active stuff in the paste the ammonium
chloride is changed into something else

theres another kind of battery which you will need to use with your
radio set that is the storage battery storage batteries can be used
over and over again if they are charged between times and will last for
a long time if properly cared for then too they can give a large
current that is a big swiftmoving stream of electrons you will need
that when you wish to heat the filament of the audion in your receiving
set

the english call our storage batteries by the name accumulators i
dont like that name at all but i dont like our name for them nearly
as well as i do the name reversible batteries nobody uses this last
name because its too late to change nevertheless a storage battery is
reversible for it will work either way at an instants notice

a storage battery is something like a boys wagon on a hill side it
will run down hill but it can be pushed up again for another descent
you can use it to send a stream of electrons through a wire from its
negative plate to its positive plate then if you connect these plates
to some other battery or to a generator that is a dynamo you can
make a stream of electrons go in the other direction when you have done
so long enough the battery is charged again and ready to discharge

i am not going to tell you very much about the storage battery but you
ought to know a little about it if you are to own and run one with your
radio set when it is all charged and ready to work the negative plate
is a lot of soft spongy lead held in place by a frame of harder lead
the positive plate is a lead frame with small squares which are filled
with lead peroxide as it is called this is a substance with molecules
formed of one lead atom and two oxygen atoms why the chemists call it
lead peroxide instead of just lead oxide ill tell you some other time
but not in these letters

between the two plates is a wood separator to keep pieces of lead from
falling down between and touching both plates you know what would
happen if a piece of metal touched both plates there would be a short
circuit that is a sort of a short cut across lots by which some of the
electrons from the negative plate could get to the positive plate
without going along the wires which we want them to travel thats why
there are separators

the two plates are in a jar of sulphuric acid solution the sulphuric
acid has molecules which split up in solution as you remember into
hydrogen ions and the ions which we called sulphate in my gravity
battery the sulphate ions used to coax the zinc ions away into the
solution in the storage battery on the other hand the sulphate ions can
get to most of the lead atoms because the lead is so spongy when they
do they form lead sulphate right where the lead atoms are they dont
really need whole lead atoms because they have two more electrons than
they deserve so there are two extra electrons for every molecule of
lead sulphate which is formed thats why the spongy lead plate is
negative

the lead sulphate wont dissolve so it stays there on the plate as a
whitish coating now see what that means what are the hydrogen ions
going to do as long as there was sulphuric acid in the water there was
plenty of sulphate ions for them to associate with as often as they met
and they would meet pretty often but if the sulphate ions get tied up
with the lead of the plate there will be too many hydrogen ions left in
the solution now what are the hydrogen ions to do they are going to
get as far away from each other as they can for they are nothing but
protons and protons dont like to associate they only stayed around in
the first place because there was always plenty of sulphate ions with
whom they liked to play

when the hydrogen ions try to get away from each other they go to the
other plate of the battery and there they will get some electrons if
they have to steal in their turn

i wont try to tell you all that happens at the other plate the
hydrogen ions get the electrons which they need but they get something
more they get some of the oxygen away from the plate and so form
molecules of water you remember that water molecules are made of two
atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen meanwhile the lead atoms which
have lost their oxygen companions combine with some of the sulphate
ions which are in that neighborhood during the mixup electrons are
carried away from the plate and that leaves it positive

the result of all this is a little lead sulphate on each plate a
negative plate where the spongy lead was and a positive plate where the
lead peroxide was

notice very carefully that i said a little lead sulphate on each
plate the sort of thing i have been describing doesnt go on very
long if it did the battery would run down inside itself and then when
we came to start our automobile we would have to get out and crank

how long does it go on answer another question first so far we havent
connected any wire between the two plates of the battery and so none of
the electrons on the negative plate have any way of getting around to
the positive plate where electrons are badly needed every time a
negative sulphate ion combines with the spongy lead of the negative
plate there are two more electrons added to that plate you know how
well electrons like each other do they let the sulphate ions keep
giving that plate more electrons there is the other question and the
answer is that they do not every electron that is added to that plate
makes it just so much harder for another sulphate ion to get near enough
to do business at all thats why after a few extra electrons have
accumulated on the spongy lead plate the actions which i was describing
come to a stop

do they ever begin again they do just as soon as there is any reduction
in the number of electrons which are hopping around in the negative
plate trying to keep out of each others way when we connect a wire
between the plates we let some of these extra electrons of the negative
plate pass along to the positive plate where they will be welcome and
the moment a couple of them start off on that errand along comes another
sulphate ion in the solution and lands two more electrons on the plate
thats how the battery keeps on discharging

we mustnt let it get too much discharged for the lead sulphate is not
soluble as i just told you and it will coat up that plate until there
isnt much chance of getting the process to reverse thats why we are
so careful not to let the discharge process go on too long before we
reverse it and charge thats why when the car battery has been used
pretty hard to start the car i like to run quite a while to let the
generator charge the battery again when the battery charges the
process reverses and we get spongy lead on the negative plate and lead
peroxide on the positive plate

youve learned enough for one day write me your questions and ill
answer and then go on in my next letter to tell how the audion works
you know about conduction of electricity in wires that is about the
electron stream and about batteries which can cause the stream now you
are ready for the most wonderful little device known to science the
audion
