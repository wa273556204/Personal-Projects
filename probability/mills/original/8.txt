electronmovingforces


this letter may be omitted on the first reading

dear young man

i trust you have a fairly good idea that an ampere means a stream of
electrons at a certain definite rate and hence that a current of say 
amperes means a stream with three times as many electrons passing along
each second

in the third and fourth letters you found out why a battery drives
electrons around a conducting circuit you also found that there are
several different kinds of batteries batteries differ in their
abilities to drive electrons and it is therefore convenient to have some
way of comparing them we do this by measuring the electronmovingforce
or electromotive force which each battery can exert to express
electromotive force and give the results of our measurements we must
have some unit the unit we use is called the volt

the volt is defined by law and is based on the suggestions of the same
body of scientists who recommended the ampere of our last letter they
defined it by telling how to make a particular kind of battery and then
saying that this battery had an electromotive force of a certain number
of volts one can buy such standard batteries or standard cells as they
are called or he can make them for himself to be sure that they are
just right he can then send them to the bureau of standards and have
them compared with the standard cells which the bureau has

i dont propose to tell you much about standard cells for you wont have
to use them until you come to study physics in real earnest they are
not good for ordinary purposes because the moment they go to work
driving electrons the conditions inside them change so their
electromotive force is changed they are delicate little affairs and are
useful only as standards with which to compare other batteries and even
as standard batteries they must be used in such a way that they are not
required to drive any electrons

illustration fig 

lets see how it can be done suppose two boys sit opposite each other
on the floor and brace their feet together then with their hands they
take hold of a stick and pull in opposite directions if both have the
same stickmotiveforce the stick will not move

now suppose we connect the negative feeti mean negative terminalsof
two batteries together as in fig  then we connect their positive
terminals together by a wire in the wire there will be lots of free
electrons ready to go to the positive plate of the battery which pulls
the harder if the batteries are equal in electromotive force these
electrons will stay right where they are there will be no stream of
electrons and yet well be using one of the batteries to compare with
the other

that is all right you think but what are we to do when the batteries
are not just equal in e m f e m f is code for electromotive
force ill tell you because the telling includes some other ideas
which will be valuable in your later reading

illustration fig 

suppose we take batteries which arent going to be injured by being made
to workstorage batteries will do nicelyand connect them in series as
in fig  when batteries are in series they act like a single stronger
battery one whose e m f is the sum of the e m fs of the separate
batteries connect these batteries to a long fine wire as in fig 
there is a stream of electrons along this wire next connect the
negative terminal of the standard cell to the negative terminal of the
storage batteries that is brace their feet against each other then
connect a wire to the positive terminal of the standard cell this wire
acts just like a long arm sticking out from the positive plate of this
cell

illustration fig 

touch the end of the wire which is p of fig  to some point
as a on the fine wire now what do we have right at a of
course there are some free electrons and they hear the calls of both
batteries if the standard battery s of the figure calls the
stronger they go to it in that case move the end p nearer the
positive plate of the battery b so that it will have a chance to
exert a stronger pull suppose we try at c and find the battery
b is there the stronger then we can move back to some point say
b where the pulls are equal

to make a test like this we put a sensitive currentmeasuring instrument
in the wire which leads from the positive terminal of the standard cell
we also use a long fine wire so that there can never be much of an
electron stream anyway when the pulls are equal there will be no
current through this instrument

as soon as we find out where the proper setting is we can replace
s by some other battery say x which we wish to compare
with s we find the setting for that battery in the same way as
we just did for s suppose it is at d in fig  while the
setting for s was at b we can see at once that x
is stronger than s the question however is how much stronger

perhaps it would be better to try to answer this question by talking
about e m fs it isnt fair to speak only of the positive plate
which calls we must speak also of the negative plate which is shooing
electrons away from itself the idea of e m f takes care of both
these actions the steady stream of electrons in the fine wire is due to
the e m f of the battery b that is to the pull of the
positive terminal and the shove of the negative

if the wire is uniform that is the same throughout its length then
each inch of it requires just as much e m f as any other inch two
inches require twice the e m f which one inch requires we know how
much e m f it takes to keep the electron stream going in the part of
the wire from n to b it takes just the e m f of the
standard cell s because when that had its feet braced at
n it pulled just as hard at b as did the big battery
b

suppose the distance n to d usually written nd is
twice as great as that from n to b nb that means
that battery x has twice the e m f of battery s you
remember that x could exert the same force through the length of
wire nd as could the large battery that is twice what cell
s can do therefore if we know how many volts to call the e m
f of the standard cell we can say that x has an e m f of
twice as many volts

if we measured dry batteries this way we should find that they each had
an e m f of about  volts a storage battery would be found to
have about  volts when fully charged and perhaps as low as  volts
when we had run it for a while

that is the way in which to compare batteries and to measure their e m
fs but you see it takes a lot of time it is easier to use a
voltmeter which is an instrument for measuring e m fs here is how
one could be made

first there is made a currentmeasuring instrument which is quite
sensitive so that its pointer will show a deflection when only a very
small stream of electrons is passing through the instrument we could
make one in the same way as we made the ammeter of the last letter but
there are other better ways of which ill tell you later then we
connect a good deal of fine wire in series with the instrument for a
reason which ill tell you in a minute the next and last step is to
calibrate

we know how many volts of e m f are required to keep going the
electron stream between n and bwe know that from the e
m f of our standard cell suppose then that we connect this new
instrument which we have just made to the wire at n and
b as in fig  some of the electrons at n which are so
anxious to get away from the negative plate of battery b can now
travel as far as b through the wire of the new instrument they
do so and the pointer swings around to some new position opposite that
we mark the number of volts which the standard battery told us there was
between n and b

illustration fig 

if we move the end of the wire from b to d the pointer
will take a new position opposite this we mark twice the number of
volts of the standard cell we can run it to a point e where the
distance ne is onehalf nb and mark our scale with half
the number of volts of the standard cell and so on for other positions
along the wire thats the way we calibrate a sensitive
currentmeasuring instrument with its added wire of course so that it
will read volts it is now a voltmeter

if we connect a voltmeter to the battery x as in fig  the
pointer will tell us the number of volts in the e m f of x
for the pointer will take the same position as it did when the voltmeter
was connected between n and d

there is only one thing to watch out for in all this we must be careful
that the voltmeter is so made that it wont offer too easy a path for
electrons to follow we only want to find how hard a battery can pull an
electron for that is what we mean by e m f of course we must let a
small stream of electrons flow through the voltmeter so as to make the
pointer move that is why voltmeters of this kind are made out of a long
piece of fine wire or else have a coil of fine wire in series with the
currentmeasuring part the fine wire makes a long and narrow path for
the electrons and so there can be only a small stream usually we
describe this condition by saying that a voltmeter has a high
resistance

illustration fig 

fine wires offer more resistance to electron streams than do heavy wires
of the same length if a wire is the same diameter all along the longer
the length of it which we use the greater is the resistance which is
offered to an electron stream

you will need to know how to describe the resistance of a wire or of any
part of an electric circuit to do so you tell how many ohms of
resistance it has the ohm is the unit in which we measure the
resistance of a circuit to an electron stream

i can show you what an ohm is if i tell you a simple way to measure a
resistance suppose you have a wire or coil of wire and want to know its
resistance connect it in series with a battery and an ammeter as shown
in fig  the same electron stream passes through all parts of this
circuit and the ammeter tells us what this stream is in amperes now
connect a voltmeter to the two ends of the coil as shown in the figure
the voltmeter tells in volts how much e m f is being applied to force
the current through the coil divide the number of volts by the number
of amperes and the quotient answer is the number of ohms of resistance
in the coil

illustration fig 

suppose the ammeter shows a current of one ampere and the voltmeter an
e m f of one volt then dividing  by  gives  that means that the
coil has a resistance of one ohm it also means one ohm is such a
resistance that one volt will send through it a current of one ampere
you can get lots of meaning out of this for example it means also that
one volt will send a current of one ampere through a resistance of one
ohm

how many ohms would the coil have if it took  volts to send  amperes
through it solution divide  by  and you get  therefore the coil
would have a resistance of  ohms

try another if a coil of resistance three ohms is carrying two amperes
what is the voltage across the terminals of the coil for  ohm it would
take  volt to give a current of  ampere wouldnt it for  ohms it
takes three times as much to give one ampere to give twice this current
would take twice  volts that is  amperes in  ohms requires x
volts

heres one for you to try by yourself if an e m f of  volts is
sending current through a resistance of  ohms how much current is
flowing notice that i told the number of ohms and the number of volts
what are you going to tell dont tell just the number tell how many
and what
