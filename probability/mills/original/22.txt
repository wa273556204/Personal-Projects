highpowered radiotelephone transmitters


my dear experimenter

this letter is to summarize the operations which must be performed in
radiotelephone transmission and reception and also to describe the
circuit of an important commercial system

to transmit speech by radio three operations are necessary first there
must be generated a highfrequency alternating current second this
current must be modulated that is varied in intensity in accordance
with the human voice and third the modulated current must be supplied
to an antenna for efficient operation of course the antenna must be
tuned to the frequency which is to be transmitted there is also a
fourth operation which is usually performed and that is amplification
wherever the electrical effect is smaller than desired or required for
satisfactory transmission vacuum tubes are used as amplifiers of this
i shall give you an illustration later

three operations are also essential in receiving first an antenna must
be so arranged and tuned as to receive energy from the distant
transmitting station there is then in the receiving antenna a current
similar in wave form to that in the transmitting antenna second the
speech significance of this current must be detected that is the
modulated current must be demodulated a current is then obtained which
has the same wave form as the human voice which was the cause of the
modulation at the distant station the third operation is performed by a
telephone receiver which makes the molecules of air in its neighborhood
move back and forth in accordance with the detected current as you
already know a fourth operation may be carried on by amplifiers which
give on their output sides currents of greater strength but of the same
forms as they receive at their input terminals

in transmitting and in receiving equipment two or more of these
operations may be performed by the same vacuum tube as you will remember
from our discussion of the regenerative circuit for receiving for
example also in any receiving set the vacuum tube which detects is
usually amplifying in the regenerative circuit for receiving continuous
waves by the heterodyne method the vacuum tube functions as a generator
of highfrequency current and as a detector of the variations in current
which occur because the locallygenerated current does not keep in step
with that generated at the transmitting station

another example of a vacuum tube performing simultaneously two different
functions is illustrated in fig  which shows a simple
radiotelephone transmitter the single tube performs in itself both the
generation of the radiofrequency current and its modulation in
accordance with the output of the carbonbutton transmitter this audion
is in a feedback circuit the oscillation frequency of which depends
upon the condenser c and the inductance l the voice
drives the diaphragm of the transmitter and thus varies the resistance
of the carbon button this varies the current from the battery
ba through the primary t of the transformer
t the result is a varying voltage applied to the grid by the
secondary t the oscillating current in the plate circuit of
the audion varies accordingly because it is dependent upon the grid
voltage the condenser cr offers a low impedance to the
radiofrequency current to which the winding t of
audiofrequency transformer offers too much

illustration fig 

in this case the tube is both generator and modulator in some cases
these operations are separately performed by different tubes this was
true of the transmitting set used in  when the engineers of the bell
telephone system talked by radio from arlington near washington d c
to paris and honolulu i shall not draw out completely the circuit of
their apparatus but i shall describe it by using little squares to
represent the parts responsible for each of the several operations

first there was a vacuum tube oscillator which generated a small current
of the desired frequency then there was a telephone transmitter which
made variations in a directcurrent flowing through the primary of a
transformer the e m f from the secondary of this transformer and the
e m f from the radiofrequency oscillator were both impressed upon
the grid of an audion which acted as a modulator the output of this
audion was a radiofrequency current modulated by the voice the output
was amplified by a twostage audion amplifier and supplied through a
coupling coil to the large antenna of the u s navy station at
arlington fig  shows the system

illustration fig 

the audion amplifiers each consisted of a number of tubes operating in
parallel when tubes are operated in parallel they are connected as
shown in fig  so that the same e m f is impressed on all the
grids and the same platebattery voltage on all the plates as the grids
vary in voltage there is a corresponding variation of current in the
plate circuit of each tube the total change of the current in the
platebattery circuit is then the sum of the changes in all the
platefilament circuits of the tubes this scheme of connections gives a
result equivalent to that of a single tube with a correspondingly larger
plate and filament

illustration fig 

parallel connection is necessary because a single tube would be
overheated in delivering to the antenna the desired amount of power you
remember that when the audion is operated as an amplifier the resistance
to which it supplies current is made equal to its own internal
resistance of rp that means that there is in the plate
circuit just as much resistance inside the tube as outside hence there
is the same amount of work done each second in forcing the current
through the tube as through the antenna circuit if that is what the
tube supplies work per second is power the plate battery is spending
energy in the tube at the same rate as it is supplying it to the antenna
where it is useful for radiation

illustration pl xibroadcasting equipment developed by the american
telephone and telegraph company and the western electric company

all the energy expended in the tube appears as heat it is due to the
blows which the electrons strike against the plate when they are drawn
across from the filament these impacts set into more rapid motion the
molecules of the plate and the temperature of the tube rises there is
a limit to the amount the temperature can rise without destroying the
tube for that reason the heat produced inside it must not exceed a
certain limit depending upon the design of the tube and the method of
cooling it as it is operated in the arlington experiments which i
mentioned a moment ago the tubes were cooled by blowing air on them
from fans

we can find the power expended in the plate circuit of a tube by
multiplying the number of volts in its battery by the number of amperes
which flows suppose the battery is  volts and the current 
amperes then the power is  watts the watt is the unit for measuring
power tubes are rated by the number of watts which can be safely
expended in them you might ask when you buy an audion what is a safe
rating for it the question will not be an important one however
unless you are to set up a transmitting set since a detector is usually
operated with such small platevoltage as not to have expended in it an
amount of power dangerous to its life

in recent transmitting sets the tubes are used in parallel for the
reasons i have just told but a different method of modulation is used
the generation of the radiofrequency current is by largepowered tubes
which are operated with high voltages in their plate circuits the
output of these oscillators is supplied to the antenna the intensity of
the oscillations of the current in these tubes is controlled by changing
the voltage applied in their plate circuits you can see from fig 
that if the plate voltage is changed the strength of the alternating
current is changed accordingly it is the method used in changing the
voltage which is particularly interesting

illustration fig 

the high voltages which are used in the plate circuits of these
highpowered audions are obtained from generators instead of batteries
you remember from letter  that an e m f is induced in a coil when
the coil and a magnet are suddenly changed in their positions one being
turned with reference to the other a generator is a machine for turning
a coil so that a magnet is always inducing an e m f in it it is
formed by an armature carrying coils and by strong electromagnets the
machine can be driven by a steam or gas engine by a water wheel or by
an electric motor generators are designed either to give steady streams
of electrons that is for dc currents or to act as alternators

illustration fig 

suppose we have as shown in fig  a dc generator supplying
current to a vacuum tube oscillator the current from the generator
passes through an ironcored choke coil marked la in the figure
between this coil and the plate circuit we connect across the line a
telephone transmitter to make a system which will work efficiently we
shall have to suppose that this transmitter has a high resistance say
about the same as the internal resistance rp of the tube and
also that it can carry as large a current

of the current which comes from the generator about onehalf goes to
the tube and the rest to the transmitter if the resistance of the
transmitter is increased it cant take as much current the coil
la however because of its inductance tends to keep the same
amount of current flowing through itself for just an instant then the
current in la keeps steady even though the transmitter doesnt
take its share the result is more current for the oscillating tube on
the other hand if the transmitter takes more current because its
resistance is decreased the choke coil la will momentarily tend
to keep the current steady so that what the transmitter takes must be
at the expense of the oscillating tube

thats one way of looking at what happens we know however from fig
 that to get an increase in the amplitude of the current in the
oscillating tube we must apply an increased voltage to its plate
circuit that is what really happens when the transmitter increases in
resistance and so doesnt take its full share of the current the
reason is this when the transmitter resistance is increased the
current in the transmitter decreases just for a moment it looks as
though the current in la is going to decrease thats the way it
looks to the electrons and you know what electrons do in an inductive
circuit when they think they shall have to stop they induce each other
to keep on for a moment for a moment they act just as if there was
some extra e m f which was acting to keep them going we say
therefore that there is an extra e m f and we call this an e m
f of selfinduction all this time there has been active on the plate
circuit of the tube the e m f of the generator to this there is
added at the instant when the transmitter resistance increases the e
m f of selfinduction in the coil la and so the total e m f
applied to the tube is momentarily increased this increased e m f
of course results in an increased amplitude for the alternating
current which the oscillator is supplying to the transmitting antenna

when the transmitter resistance is decreased and a larger current
should flow through the choke coil the electrons are asked to speed up
in going through the coil at first they object and during that instant
they express their objection by an e m f of selfinduction which
opposes the generator voltage for an instant then the voltage of the
oscillating tube is lowered and its alternatingcurrent output is
smaller

illustration fig 

for the purpose of bringing about such threatened changes in current
and hence such e m fs of selfinduction the carbon transmitter is
not suitable because it has too small a resistance and too small a
current carrying ability the plate circuit of a vacuum tube will serve
admirably you know from the audion characteristic that without changing
the plate voltage we can by applying a voltage to the grid change the
current through the plate circuit now if it was a wire resistance with
which we were dealing and we should be able to obtain a change in
current without changing the voltage acting on this wire we would say
that we had changed the resistance we can say therefore that the
internal resistance of the plate circuit of a vacuum tube can be changed
by what we do to the grid

in fig  i have substituted the plate circuit of an audion for the
transmitter of fig  and arranged to vary its resistance by changing
the potential of the grid this we do by impressing upon the grid the e
m f developed in the secondary of a transformer to the primary of
which is connected a battery and a carbon transmitter the current
through the primary varies in accordance with the sounds spoken into the
transmitter and for all the reasons which we have just finished
studying there are similar variations in the output current of the
oscillating tube in the transmitting set of fig 

in this latter figure you will notice a small aircore coil
lr between the oscillator and the modulator tube this coil
has a small inductance but it is enough to offer a large impedance to
radiofrequency currents the result is it does not let the alternating
currents of the oscillating tube flow into the modulator these currents
are confined to their own circuit where they are useful in establishing
similar currents in the antenna on the other hand the coil lr
doesnt seriously impede lowfrequency currents and therefore it does
not prevent variations in the current which are at audiofrequency it
does not interfere with the changes in current which accompany the
variations in the resistance of the plate circuit of the modulator
that is it has too little impedance to act like la and so it
permits the modulator to vary the output of the oscillator

illustration fig 

the oscillating circuit of fig  includes part of the antenna it
differs also from the others i have shown in the manner in which grid
and plate circuits are coupled ill explain by fig 

the transmitting set which i have just described involves many of the
principles of the most modern sets if you understand its operation you
can probably reason out for yourself any of the other sets of which you
will hear from time to time
