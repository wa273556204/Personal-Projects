condensers and coils


dear son

in the last letter we learned of an alternating e m f the way of
producing it which i described is very crude and i want to tell how to
make the audion develop an alternating e m f for itself that is what
the audion does in the transmitting set of a radio telephone but an
audion cant do it all alone it must have associated with it some coils
and a condenser you know what i mean by coils but you have yet to learn
about condensers

a condenser is merely a gap in an otherwise conducting circuit its a
gap across which electrons cannot pass so that if there is an e m f
in the circuit electrons will be very plentiful on one side of the gap
and scarce on the other side if there are to be many electrons waiting
beside the gap there must be room for them for that reason we usually
provide waitingrooms for the electrons on each side of the gap metal
plates or sheets of tinfoil serve nicely for this purpose look at fig
 you see a battery and a circuit which would be conducting except for
the gap at c on each side of the gap there is a sheet of metal
the metal sheets may be separated by air or mica or paraffined paper
the combination of gap plates and whatever is between provided it is
not conducting is called a condenser

let us see what happens when we connect a battery to a condenser as in
the figure the positive terminal of the battery calls electrons from
one plate of the condenser while the negative batteryterminal drives
electrons away from itself toward the other plate of the condenser one
plate of the condenser therefore becomes positive while the other
plate becomes negative

illustration fig 

you know that this action of the battery will go on until there are so
many electrons in the negative plate of the condenser that they prevent
the battery from adding any more electrons to that plate the same thing
happens at the other condenser plate the positive terminal of the
battery calls electrons away from the condenser plate which it is making
positive until so many electrons have left that the protons in the atoms
of the plate are calling for electrons to stay home just as loudly and
effectively as the positive batteryterminal is calling them away

when both these conditions are reachedand they are both reached at the
same timethen the battery has to stop driving electrons around the
circuit the battery has not enough e m f to drive any more
electrons why because the condenser has now just enough e m f with
which to oppose the battery

it would be well to learn at once the right words to use in describing
this action we say that the battery sends a charging current around
its circuit and charges the condenser until it has the same e m f
when the battery is first connected to the condenser there is lots of
space in the waitingrooms so there is a great rush or surge of
electrons into one plate and away from the other just at this first
instant the charging current therefore is large but it decreases
rapidly for the moment electrons start to pile up on one plate of the
condenser and to leave the other an e m f builds up on the
condenser this e m f of course opposes that of the battery so that
the net e m f acting to move electrons round the circuit is no longer
that of the battery but is the difference between the e m f of the
battery and that of the condenser and so with each added electron the
e m f of the condenser increases until finally it is just equal to
that of the battery and there is no net e m f to act

what would happen if we should then disconnect the battery the
condenser would be left with its extra electrons in the negative plate
and with its positive plate lacking the same number of electrons that
is the condenser would be left charged and its e m f would be of
the same number of volts as the battery

illustration fig 

now suppose we connect a short wire between the plates of the condenser
as in fig  the electrons rush home from the negative plate to the
positive plate as fast as electrons get home the e m f decreases
when they are all back the e m f has been reduced to zero sometimes
we say that the condenser discharges the discharge current starts
with a rush the moment the conducting path is offered between the two
plates the e m f of the condenser falls the discharge current grows
smaller and in a very short time the condenser is completely
discharged

illustration fig 

thats what happens when there is a short conducting path for the
discharge current if that were all that could happen i doubt if there
would be any radio communication today but if we connect a coil of
wire between two plates of a charged condenser as in fig  then
something of great interest happens to understand you must know
something more about electron streams

suppose we should wind a few turns of wire on a cylindrical core say on
a stiff cardboard tube we shall use insulated wire now start from one
end of the coil say a and follow along the coiled wire for a
few turns and then scratch off the insulation and solder onto the coil
two wires b and c as shown in fig  the further end
of the coil we shall call d now lets arrange a battery and
switch so that we can send a current through the part of the coil
between a and b arrange also a currentmeasuring instrument so as
to show if any current is flowing in the part of the coil between c
and d for this purpose we shall use a kind of currentmeasuring
instrument which i have not yet explained it is different from the
hotwire type described in letter  for it will show in which direction
electrons are streaming through it

the diagram of fig  indicates the apparatus of our experiment when
we close the switch s the battery starts a stream of electrons
from a towards b just at that instant the needle or
pointer of the current instrument moves the needle moves and thus
shows a current in the coil cd but it comes right back again
showing that the current is only momentary lets say this again in
different words the battery keeps steadily forcing electrons through
the circuit ab but the instrument in the circuit cd shows
no current in that circuit except just at the instant when current
starts to flow in the neighboring circuit ab

illustration fig 

one thing this currentmeasuring instrument tells us is the direction of
the electron stream through itself it shows that the momentary stream
of electrons goes through the coil from d to c that is in
the opposite direction to the stream in the part ab

now prepare to do a little close thinking read over carefully all i
have told you about this experiment you see that the moment the battery
starts a stream of electrons from a towards b something causes
a momentary that is a temporary movement of electrons from d to
c we say that starting a stream of electrons from a to b sets
up or induces a stream of electrons from d to c

what will happen then if we connect the battery between a and d
as in fig  electrons will start streaming away from a towards
b that is towards d but that means there will be a momentary
stream from d towards c that is towards a our stream from
the battery causes this oppositely directed stream in the usual
words we say it induces in the coil an opposing stream of electrons
this opposing stream doesnt last long as we saw but while it does
last it hinders the stream which the battery is trying to establish

illustration fig 

the stream of electrons which the battery causes will at first meet an
opposition so it takes a little time before the battery can get the
fullsized stream of electrons flowing steadily in other words a
current in a coil builds up slowly because while it is building up it
induces an effect which opposes somewhat its own building up

did you ever see a small boy start off somewhere perhaps where he
shouldnt be going and find his conscience starting to trouble him at
once for a time he goes a little slowly but in a moment or two his
conscience stops opposing him and he goes on steadily at his full pace
when he started he stirred up his conscience and that opposed him
nobody else was hindering his going it was all brought about by his
own actions the opposition which he met was selfinduced he was
hindered at first by a selfinduced effect of his own conscience if he
was a stream of electrons starting off to travel around the coil we
would say that he was opposed by a selfinduced e m f and any path
in which such an effect will be produced we say has selfinductance
usually we shorten this term and speak of inductance

there is another way of looking at it we know habits are hard to form
and equally hard to break its hard to get electrons going around a
coil and the selfinductance of a circuit tells us how hard it is the
harder it is the more selfinductance we say that the coil or circuit
has of course we need a unit in which to measure selfinductance the
unit is called the henry but that is more selfinductance than we can
stand in most radio circuits so we find it convenient to measure in
smaller units called milhenries which are thousandths of a henry

you ought to know what a henry is if we are to use the word but it
isnt necessary just now to spend much time on it the opposition which
ones selfinduced conscience offers depends upon how rapidly one
starts its volts which make electrons move and so the conscience which
opposes them will be measured in volts therefore we say that a coil has
one henry of inductance when an electron stream which is increasing one
amperes worth each second stirs up in the coil a conscientious
objection of one volt dont try to remember this now you can come back
to it later

there is one more effect of inductance which we must know before we can
get very far with our radio suppose an electron stream is flowing
through a coil because a battery is driving the electrons along now let
the battery be removed or disconnected youd expect the electron stream
to stop at once but it doesnt it keeps on for a moment because the
electrons have got the habit

illustration fig 

if you look again at fig  you will see what i mean suppose the
switch is closed and a steady stream of electrons is flowing through the
coil from a to b there will be no current in the other
part of the coil now open the switch there will be a motion of the
needle of the currentmeasuring instrument showing a momentary current
the direction of this motion however shows that the momentary stream
of electrons goes through the coil from c to d

do you see what this means the moment the battery is disconnected there
is nothing driving the electrons in the part ab and they slow
down immediately and just for an instant a stream of electrons starts
off in the part cd in the same direction as if the battery was
driving them along

now look again at fig  if the battery is suddenly disconnected there
is a momentary rush of electrons in the same direction as the battery
was driving them just as the selfinductance of a coil opposes the
starting of a stream of electrons so it opposes the stopping of a
stream which is already going

illustration fig 

so far we havent said much about making an audion produce alternating
e m fs and thus making it useful for radiotelephony before radio
was possible all these things that i have just told you and some more
too had to be known it took hundreds of good scientists years of
patient study and experiment to find out those ideas about electricity
which have made possible radiotelephony

two of these ideas are absolutely necessary for the student of
radiocommunication first a condenser is a gap in a circuit where
there are waitingrooms for the electrons second electrons form
habits its hard to get them going through a coil of wire harder than
through a straight wire but after they are going they dont like to
stop they like it much less if they are going through a coil instead of
a straight wire

in my next letter ill tell you what happens when we have a coil and a
condenser together in a circuit

footnote  the henry has nothing to do with a wellknown automobile
it was named after joseph henry a professor years ago at princeton
university
