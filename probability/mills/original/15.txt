radiotelephony


dear lad

before we start on the important subject matter of this letter let us
make a short review of the preceding two letters

an oscillating audion at the transmitting station produces an effect on
the plate current of the detector audion at the receiving station there
is impressed upon the grid of the detector an alternating e m f which
has the same frequency as the alternating current which is being
produced at the sending station while this e m f is active and of
course it is active only while the sending key is held down there is
more current through the winding of the telephone receiver and its
diaphragm is consequently pulled closer to its magnet

what will happen if the e m f which is active on the grid of the
detector is made stronger or weaker the pull on the receiver diaphragm
will be stronger or weaker and the diaphragm will have to move
accordingly if the pull is weaker the elasticity of the iron will move
the diaphragm away from the magnet but if the pull is stronger the
diaphragm will be moved toward the magnet

every time the diaphragm moves it affects the air in the immediate
neighborhood of itself and that air in turn affects the air farther away
and so the ear of the listener therefore if there are changes in the
intensity or strength of the incoming signal there are going to be
corresponding motions of the receiver diaphragm and something to
listen too if these changes are frequent enough but not so frequent
that the receiver diaphragm has difficulty in following them

there are many ways of affecting the strength of the incoming signal
suppose for example that we arrange to decrease the current in the
antenna of the transmitting station that will mean a weaker signal and
a smaller increase in current through the winding of the telephone
receiver at the other station on the other hand if the signal strength
is increased there is more current in this winding

illustration fig 

suppose we connect a fine wire in the antenna circuit as in fig  and
have a sliding contact as shown suppose that when we depress the switch
in the oscillator circuit and so start the oscillations that the sliding
contact is at o as shown corresponding to that strength of
signal there is a certain value of current through the receiver winding
at the other station now let us move the slider first to a and
then back to b and so on back and forth you see what will
happen we alternately make the current in the antenna larger and
smaller than it originally was when the slider is at b there is
more of the fine wire in series with the antenna hence more resistance
to the oscillations of the electrons and hence a smaller oscillating
stream of electrons that means a weaker outgoing signal when the
slider is at a there is less resistance in the antenna circuit
and a larger alternating current

illustration fig 

illustration fig 

a picture of what happens would be like that of fig  the signal
varies in intensity therefore becoming larger and smaller alternately
that means the voltage impressed on the grid of the detector is
alternately larger and smaller and hence the stream of electrons
through the winding of the telephone receiver is alternately larger and
smaller and that means that the diaphragm moves back and forth in just
the time it takes to move the slider back and forth

instead of the slider we might use a little cup almost full of grains of
carbon the carbon grains lie between two flat discs of carbon one of
these discs is held fixed the other is connected to the center of a
thin diaphragm of steel and moves back and forth as this diaphragm is
moved the whole thing makes a telephone transmitter such as you have
often talked to

illustration fig a

wires connect to the carbon discs as shown in fig  a stream of
electrons can flow through the wires and from grain to grain through the
carbon button as we call it the electrons have less difficulty if
the grains are compressed that is the button then offers less
resistance to the flow of current if the diaphragm moves back allowing
the grains to have more room the electron stream is smaller and we say
the button is offering more resistance to the current

illustration fig b

you can see what happens suppose some one talks into the transmitter
and makes its diaphragm go back and forth as shown in fig a then the
current in the antenna varies being greater or less depending upon
whether the button offers less or more resistance the corresponding
variations in the antenna current are shown in fig b

in the antenna at the receiving station there are corresponding
variations in the strength of the signal and hence corresponding
variations in the strength of the current through the telephone
receiver i shall show graphically what happens in fig  you see that
the telephone receiver diaphragm does just the same motions as does the
transmitter diaphragm that means that the molecules of air near the
receiver diaphragm are going through just the same kind of motions as
are those near the transmitter diaphragm when these air molecules
affect your eardrum you hear just what you would have heard if you had
been right there beside the transmitter

thats one way of making a radiotelephone it is not a very efficient
method but it has been used in the past before we look at any of the
more recent methods we can draw some general ideas from this method and
learn some words that are used almost always in speaking of
radiotelephones

in any system of radiotelephony you will always find that there is
produced at the transmitting station a highfrequency alternating
current and that this current flows in a tuned circuit one part of which
is the condenser formed by the antenna and the ground or something
which acts like a ground this highfrequency current or
radiocurrent as we usually say is varied in its strength it is
varied in conformity with the human voice if the human voice speaking
into the transmitter is low pitched there are slow variations in the
intensity of the radio current if the voice is high pitched there are
more rapid variations in the strength of the radiofrequency current
that is why we say the radiocurrent is modulated by the human voice

illustration fig 

the signal which radiates out from the transmitting antenna carries all
the little variations in pitch and loudness of the human voice when
this signal reaches the distant antenna it establishes in that antenna
circuit a current of high frequency which has just the same variations
as did the current in the antenna at the sending station the human
voice isnt there it is not transmitted it did its work at the sending
station by modulating the radiosignal modulating the carrier
current as we sometimes say but there is speech significance hidden
in the variations in strength of the received signal

if a telephonereceiver diaphragm can be made to vibrate in accordance
with the variations in signal intensity then the air adjacent to that
diaphragm will be set into vibration and these vibrations will be just
like those which the human voice set up in the air molecules near the
mouth of the speaker all the different systems of receiving
radiotelephone signals are merely different methods of getting a
current which will affect the telephone receiver in conformity with the
variations in signal strength getting such a current is called
detecting there are many different kinds of detectors but the vacuum
tube is much to be preferred

the cheapest detector but not the most sensitive is the crystal if
you understand how the audion works as a detector you will have no
difficulty in understanding the crystal detector

the crystal detector consists of some mineral crystal and a finewire
point usually platinum crystals are peculiar things like everything
else they are made of molecules and these molecules of atoms the atoms
are made of electrons grouped around nuclei which in turn are formed
by close groupings of protons and electrons the great difference
between crystals and substances which are not crystalline that is
substances which dont have a special natural shape is this in
crystals the molecules and atoms are all arranged in some orderly
manner in other substances substances without special form amorphous
substances as we call them the molecules are just grouped together in
a haphazard way

illustration fig 

for some crystals we know very closely indeed how their molecules or
rather their individual atoms are arranged sometime you may wish to
read how this was found out by the use of xrays take the crystal of
common salt for example that is well known each molecule of salt is
formed by an atom of sodium and one of chlorine in a crystal of salt
the molecules are grouped together so that a sodium atom always has
chlorine atoms on every side of it and the other way around of course

suppose you took a lot of wood dumbbells and painted one of the balls
of each dumbbell black to stand for a sodium atom leaving the other
unpainted to stand for a chlorine atom now try to pile them up so that
above and below each black ball to the right and left of it and also
in front and behind it there shall be a white ball the pile which you
would probably get would look like that of fig  i have omitted the
gripping part of each dumbell because i dont believe it is there in my
picture each circle represents the nucleus of an atom i havent
attempted to show the planetary electrons other crystals have more
complex arrangements for piling up their molecules

now suppose we put two different kinds of substances close together
that is make contact between them how their electrons will behave will
depend entirely upon what the atoms are and how they are piled up some
very curious effects can be obtained

illustration fig 

the one which interests us at present is that across the contact points
of some combinations of substances it is easier to get a stream of
electrons to flow one way than the other the contact doesnt have the
same resistance in the two directions usually also the resistance
depends upon what voltage we are applying to force the electron stream
across the point of contact

the one way to find out is to take the voltagecurrent characteristic of
the combination to do so we use the same general method as we did for
the audion and when we get through we plot another curve and call it
for example a platinumgalena characteristic fig  shows the
setup for making the measurements there is a group of batteries
arranged so that we can vary the e m f applied across the contact
point of the crystal and platinum a voltmeter shows the value of this
e m f and an ammeter tells the strength of the electron stream each
time we move the slider we get a new pair of values for volts and
amperes as a matter of fact we dont get amperes or even milamperes
we get millionths of an ampere or microamperes as we say we can
plot the pairs of values which we measure and make a curve like that of
fig 

illustration fig 

when the voltage across the contact is reversed of course the current
reverses part of the curve looks something like the lower part of an
audion characteristic

illustration fig 

now connect this crystal in a receiving circuit as in fig  we use an
antenna just as we did for the audion and we tune the antenna circuit to
the frequency of the incoming signal the receiving circuit is coupled
to the antenna circuit and is tuned to the same frequency whatever
voltage there may be across the condenser of this circuit is applied to
the crystal detector we havent put the telephone receiver in the
circuit yet i want to wait until you have seen what the crystal does
when an alternating voltage is applied to it

illustration fig 

we can draw a familiar form of sketch as in fig  to show how the
current in the crystal varies you see that there flows through the
crystal a current very much like that of fig a and you know that
such a current is really equivalent to two electron streams one steady
and the other alternating the crystal detector gives us much the same
sort of a current as does the vacuum tube detector of fig  the
current isnt anywhere near as large however for it is microamperes
instead of milamperes

our crystal detector produces the same results so far as giving us a
steady component of current to send through a telephone receiver so we
can connect a receiver in series with the crystal as shown in fig 
because the receiver would offer a large impedance to the highfrequency
current that is seriously impede and so reduce the highfrequency
current we connect a condenser around the receiver

illustration fig 

there is a simple crystal detector circuit if the signal intensity
varies then the current which passes through the receiver will vary if
these variations are caused by a human voice at the sending station the
crystal will permit one to hear from the telephone receiver what the
speaker is saying that is just what the audion detector does very many
times better

in the letter on how to experiment youll find details as to the
construction of a crystaldetector set excellent instructions for an
inexpensive set are contained in bull no  of the bureau of
