a cw transmitter


dear son

illustration fig 

lets look again at the coils of fig  which we studied in the last
letter i have reproduced them here so you wont have to turn back when
electrons start from a towards b there is a momentary
stream of electrons from d towards c if the electron
stream through ab were started in the opposite direction that is
from b to a the induced stream in the coil cd would
be from c towards d

illustration fig 

it all reminds me of two boys with a hedge or fence between them as in
fig  one boy is after the other suppose you were being chased you
know what youd do if your pursuer started off with a rush towards one
end of the hedge youd beat it towards the other but if he started
slowly and cautiously you would start slowly too you always go in the
opposite direction dodging back and forth along the paths which you are
wearing in the grass on opposite sides of the hedge if he starts to the
right and then slows up and starts back you will start to your right
slow up and start back suppose he starts at the center of the hedge
first he dodges to the right and then back through the center as far to
the left then back again and so on you follow his every change

illustration fig 

i am going to make a picture of what you two do lets start with the
other fellow he dodges or alternates back and forth some persons would
say he oscillates back and forth in the same path as he does so he
induces you to move i am on your side of the hedge with a
movingpicture camera my camera catches both of you fig  shows the
way the film would look if it caught only your heads the white circle
represents the towhead on my side of the hedge and the black circle
young brown who lives next door of course the camera only catches you
each time the shutter opens but it is easy to draw a complete picture of
what takes place as time goes on see fig 

illustration fig 

now suppose you are an electron in coil cd of fig  and
brownie is one in coil ab your motions are induced by his
whats true of you two is true of all the other electrons i have
separated the coils a little in this sketch so that you can think of a
hedge between i dont know how one electron can affect another on the
opposite side of this hedge but it can and i dont know anything really
about the hedge which is generally called the ether the hedge isnt
air the effect would be the same if the coils were in a vacuum the
ether is just a name for whatever is left in the space about us when
we have taken out everything which we can see or feelevery molecule
every proton and every electron

illustration fig 

why and how electrons can affect one another when they are widely
separated is one of the great mysteries of science we dont know any
more about it than about why there are electrons lets accept it as a
fundamental fact which we cant as yet explain

illustration fig 

and now we can see how to make an audion produce an alternating current
or as we sometimes say make an audion oscillator we shall set up an
audion with its abattery as in fig  between the grid and the
filament we put a coil and a condenser notice that they are in
parallel as we say in the platefilament circuit we connect the
bbattery and a switch s and another coil this coil in the
plate circuit of the audion we place close to the other coil so that the
two coils are just like the coils ab and cd of which i
have been telling you the moment any current flows in coil ab
there will be a current flow in the coil cd an induced electron
stream of course as long as the switch in the bbattery is open no
current can flow

the moment the switch s is closed the bbattery makes the plate
positive with respect to the filament and there is a sudden surge of
electrons round the plate circuit and through the coil from a to
b you know what that does to the coil cd it induces an
electron stream from d towards c where do these electrons
come from why from the grid and the plate  of the condenser where do
they go most of them go to the waitingroom offered by plate  of the
condenser and some of course to the filament what is the result the
grid becomes positive and the filament negative

illustration fig 

this is the crucial moment in our study can you tell me what is going
to happen to the stream of electrons in the plate circuit remember that
just at the instant when we closed the switch the grid was neither
positive nor negative we were at the point of zero volts on the audion
characteristic of fig  when we close the switch the current in the
plate circuit starts to jump from zero milamperes to the number of
milamperes which represents the point where zero volt st crosses
audion characteristic but this jump in plate current makes the grid
positive as we have just seen so the grid will help the plate call
electrons and that will make the current in the plate circuit still
larger that is result in a larger stream of electrons from a to
b

this increase in current will be matched by an increased effect in the
coil cd for you remember how you and brownie behaved and that
will pull more electrons away from plate  of the condenser and send
them to the waitingroom of  all this makes the grid more positive and
so makes it call all the more effectively to help the plate move
electrons

instrument company

we started something that time its going on all by itself the grid
is getting more positive the plate current is getting bigger and so
the grid is getting more positive and the plate current still bigger is
it ever going to stop yes look at the audion characteristic there
comes a time when making the grid a little more positive wont have any
effect on the platecircuit current so the plate current stops
increasing

there is nothing now to keep pulling electrons away from plate  and
crowding them into waitingroom  why shouldnt the electrons in this
waitingroom go home to that of plate  there is now no reason and so
they start off with a rush

of course some of them came from the grid and as fast as electrons get
back to the grid it becomes less and less positive as the grid becomes
less and less positive it becomes less and less helpful to the plate

if the grid doesnt help the plate alone cant keep up this stream of
electrons all the plate can do by itself is to maintain the current
represented by the intersection of zero volts and the audion
characteristic the result is that the current in the plate circuit
that is of course the current in coil ab becomes gradually less
about the time all the electrons which had left the grid and plate 
of the condenser have got home the plate current is back to the value
corresponding to ec

the plate current first increases and then decreases but it doesnt
stop decreasing when it gets back to zerogrid value and the reason is
all due to the habit forming tendencies of electrons in coils to see
how this comes about lets tell the whole story over again in other
words lets make a review and so get a sort of flying start

illustration fig 

when we close the battery switch s in fig  we allow a
current to flow in the plate circuit this current induces a current in
the coil cd and charges the condenser which is across it making
plate  positive and plate  negative a positive grid helps the plate
so that the current in the plate circuit builds up to the greatest
possible value as shown by the audion characteristic thats the end of
the increase in current now the condenser discharges sending electrons
through the coil cd and making the grid less positive until
finally it is at zero potential that is neither positive nor negative

while the condenser is discharging the electrons in the coil cd
get a habit of flowing from c toward d that is from plate
 to plate  if it wasnt for this habit the electron stream in
cd would stop as soon as the grid had reduced to zero voltage
because of the habit however a lot of electrons that ought to stay on
plate  get hurried along and land on plate  it is a little like the
old game of crack the whip some electrons get the habit and cant
stop quickly enough so they go tumbling into waitingroom  and make it
negative

that means that the condenser not only discharges but starts to get
charged in the other direction with plate  negative and plate 
positive the grid feels the effect of all this because it gets extra
electrons if plate  gets them in fact the voltage effective between
grid and filament is always the voltage between the plates of the
condenser

the audion characteristic tells us what is the result as the grid
becomes negative it opposes the plate shooing electrons back towards
the filament and reducing the plate current still further but you have
already seen in my previous letter what happens when we reduce the
current in coil ab there is then induced in coil cd an
electron stream from c to d this induced current is in
just the right direction to send more electrons into waitingroom  and
so to make the grid still more negative and the more negative the grid
gets the smaller becomes the plate current until finally the plate
current is reduced to zero look at the audion characteristic again and
see that making the grid sufficiently negative entirely stops the plate
current

when the plate current stops the condenser in the grid circuit is
charged with plate  negative and  positive it was the plate current
which was the main cause of this change for it induced the charging
current in coil cd so when the plate current becomes zero there
is nothing to prevent the condenser from discharging

its discharge makes the grid less and less negative until it is zero
volts and there we areback practically where we started the plate
current is increasing and the grid is getting positive and were off on
another cycle as we say during a cycle the plate current increases to
a maximum decreases to zero and then increases again to its initial
value

illustration fig 

this letter has a longer continuous train of thought than i usually ask
you to follow but before i stop i want to give you some idea of what
good this is in radio

what about the current which flows in coil cd its an
alternating current isnt it first the electrons stream from d
towards c and then back again from c towards d

suppose we set up another coil like cd in fig  it would have
an alternating current induced in it if this coil was connected to an
antenna there would be radio waves sent out the switch s could
be used for a key and kept closed longer or shorter intervals depending
upon whether dashes or dots were being set ill tell you more about
this later but in this diagram are the makings of a cw transmitter
that is a continuous wave transmitter for radiotelegraphy

it would be worth while to go over this letter again using a pencil and
tracing in the various circuits the electron streams which i have
described
