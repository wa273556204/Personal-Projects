the audioncharacteristic


my dear young student

although there is much in letters  and  which it is well to learn and
to think about there are only three of the ideas which you must have
firmly grasped to get the most out of this letter which i am now going
to write you about the audion

first electric currents are streams of electrons we measure currents
in amperes to measure a current we may connect into the circuit an
ammeter

second electrons move in a circuit when there is an
electronmovingforce that is an electromotive force or e m f we
measure e m fs in volts to measure an e m f we connect a
voltmeter to the two points between which the e m f is active

third what current any particular e m f will cause depends upon the
circuit in which it is active circuits differ in the resistance which
they offer to e m fs for any particular e m f that is for any
given e m f the resulting current will be smaller the greater the
resistance of the circuit we measure resistance in ohms to measure it
we find the quotient of the number of volts applied to the circuit by
the number of amperes which flow

in my sixth letter i told you something of how the audion works it
would be worth while to read again that letter you remember that the
current in the plate circuit can be controlled by the e m f which is
applied to the grid circuit there is a relationship between the plate
current and the grid voltage which is peculiar or characteristic to the
tube so we call such a relationship a characteristic let us see how
it may be found and what it will be

connect an ammeter in the plate or bcircuit of the tube so as to
measure the platecircuit current you will find that almost all books
use the letter i to stand for current the reason is that
scientists used to speak of the intensity of an electric current so
that i really stands for intensity we use i to stand
for something more than the word current it is our symbol for
whatever an ammeter would read that is for the amount of current

illustration fig 

another convenience in symbols is this we shall frequently want to
speak of the currents in several different circuits it saves time to
use another letter along with the letter i to show the circuit to
which we refer for example we are going to talk about the current in
the bcircuit of the audion so we call that current ib we
write the letter b below the line on which i stands that
is why we say the b is subscript meaning written below when
you are reading to yourself be sure to read ib as eyebee or
else as eyesubscriptbee ib therefore will stand for the
number of amperes in the plate circuit of the audion in the same way
ia would stand for the current in the filament circuit

we are going to talk about e m fs also the letter e stands
for the number of volts of e m f in a circuit in the filament
circuit the battery has ea volts in the plate circuit the e
m f is eb volts if we put a battery in the grid circuit we
can let ec represent the number of volts applied to the
gridfilament or ccircuit

the characteristic relation which we are after is one between grid
voltage that is ec and plate current that is ib
so we call it the ecib characteristic the dash
between the letters is not a subtraction sign but merely a dash to
separate the letters now well find the eeseeeyebee
characteristic

connect some small dry cells in series for use in the grid circuit then
connect the filament to the middle cell as in fig  take the wire
which comes from the grid and put a battery clip on it then you can
connect the grid anywhere you want along this series of batteries see
fig  in the figure this movable clip is represented by an arrow
head you can see that if it is at a the battery will make the
grid positive if it is moved to b the grid will be more
positive on the other hand if the clip is at o there will be no
e m f applied to the grid if it is at c the grid will be made
negative

between grid and filament there is placed a voltmeter which will tell
how much e m f is applied to the grid that is tell the value of
ec for any position whatever of the clip

we shall start with the filament heated to a deep red the manufacturers
of the audion tell the purchaser what current should flow through the
filament so that there will be the proper emission of electrons there
are easy ways of finding out for ones self but we shall not stop to
describe them the makers also tell how many volts to apply to the
plate that is what value eb should have we could find this
out also for ourselves but we shall not stop to do so

illustration fig 

now we set the battery clip so that there is no voltage applied to the
grid that is we start with ec equal to zero then we read the
ammeter in the plate circuit to find the value of ib which
corresponds to this condition of the grid

next we move the clip so as to make the grid as positive as one battery
will make it that is we move the clip to a in fig  we now
have a different value of ec and will find a different value
of ib when we read the ammeter next move the clip to apply
two batteries to the grid we get a new pair of values for ec
and ib getting ec from the voltmeter and ib from the
ammeter as we continue in this way increasing ec we find that
the current ib increases for a while and then after we have
reached a certain value of ec the current ib stops
increasing adding more batteries and making the grid more positive
doesnt have any effect on the plate current

illustration fig 

before i tell you why this happens i want to show you how to make a
picture of the pairs of values of ec and ib which we
have been reading on the voltmeter and ammeter

imagine a city where all the streets are at right angles and the north
and south streets are called streets and numbered while the east and
west thorofares are called avenues ill draw the map as in fig 
right through the center of the city goes main street but the people
who laid out the roads were mathematicians and instead of calling it
main street they called it zero street the first street east of zero
st we should have called east first street but they called it
positive  st and the next beyond positive  st and so on west
of the main street they called the first street negative  st and so
on

when they came to name the avenues they were just as precise and
mathematical they called the main avenue zero ave and those north of
it positive  ave positive  ave and so on of course the
avenues south of zero ave they called negative

the town council went almost crazy on the subject of numbering they
numbered everything the silent policeman which stood at the corner of
positive  st and positive  ave was marked that way half way
between positive  st and positive  st there was a garage which set
back about twotenths of a block from positive  ave the council
numbered it and called it positive  st and positive  ave most
of the people spoke of it as plus  st and plus  ave

sometime later there was an election in the city and a new council was
elected the members were mostly young electricians and the new highway
commissioner was a radio enthusiast at the first meeting the council
changed the names of all the avenues to milamperes and of all the
streets to volts

then the highway commissioner who had just been taking a set of
voltmeter and ammeter readings on an audion moved that there should be a
new road known as audion characteristic he said the road should pass
through the following points

    zero volt and plus  milampere
    plus  volts and plus  milamperes
    plus  volts and plus  milamperes
    plus  volts and plus  milamperes
    plus  volts and plus  milamperes

and so on fig  shows the new road

illustration fig 

one member of the council jumped up and said but what if the grid is
made negative the commissioner had forgotten to see what happened so
he went home to take more readings

he shifted the battery clip along starting at c of fig  at
the next meeting of the council he brought in the following list of
readings and hence of points on his proposed road

    minus  volts and plus  milampere
                             
                             
                             
                             

then he showed the other members of the council on the map of fig 
how the audion characteristic would look

illustration fig 

there was considerable discussion after that and it appeared that
different designs and makes of audions would have different
characteristic curves they all had the same general form of curve but
they would pass through different sets of points depending upon the
design and upon the bbattery voltage it was several meetings later
however before they found out what effects were due to the form of the
curve right after this they found that they could get much better
results with their radio sets

now look at the audion characteristic making the grid positive that is
going on the positive side of the zero volts in our map makes the plate
current larger you remember that i told you in letter  how the grid
when positive helped call electrons away from the filament and so made
a larger stream of electrons in the plate circuit the grid calls
electrons away from the filament it cant call them out of it they
have to come out themselves as i explained to you in the fifth letter

illustration fig 

you can see that as we make the grid more and more positive that is
make it call louder and louder a condition will be reached where it
wont do it any good to call any louder for it will already be getting
all the electrons away from the filament just as fast as they are
emitted making the grid more positive after that will not increase the
plate current any thats why the characteristic flattens off as you see
at high values of grid voltage

the arrangement which we pictured in fig  for making changes in the
grid voltage is simple but it doesnt let us change the voltage by less
than that of a single battery cell i want to show you a way which will
youll find it very useful to know and it is easily understood for it is
something like the arrangement of fig  in the preceding letter

illustration fig 

connect the cells as in fig  to a fine wire about the middle of this
wire connect the filament as before use a clip on the end of the wire
from the grid if the grid is connected to a in the figure there
is applied to the grid circuit that part of the e m f of the battery
which is active in the length of wire between o and a the
point a is nearer the positive plate of the battery than is the
point o so the grid will be positive and the filament negative

on the other hand if the clip is connected at b the grid will be
negative with respect to the filament we can therefore make the grid
positive or negative depending on which side of o we connect the
clip how large the e m f is which will be applied to the grid
depends of course upon how far away from o the clip is
connected

suppose you took the clip in your hand and slid it along in contact with
the wire first from o to a and then back again through
o to b and so on back and forth you would be making the
grid alternately positive and negative wouldnt you that is
you would be applying to the grid an e m f which increases to some
positive value and then decreasing to zero reverses and
increases just as much only to decrease to zero where it started if
you do this over and over again taking always the same time for one
round trip of the clip you will be impressing on the grid circuit an
alternating e m f

whats going to happen in the plate circuit when there is no e m f
applied to the grid circuit that is when the grid potential
possibilities is zero there is a definite current in the plate
circuit that current we can find from our characteristic of fig  for
it is where the curve crosses zero volts as the grid becomes positive
the current rises above this value when the grid is made negative the
current falls below this value the current ib then is made
alternately greater and less than the current when ec is zero

you might spend a little time thinking over this seeing what happens
when an alternating e m f is applied to the grid of an audion for
that is going to be fundamental to our study of radio

footnote  a milampere is a thousandth of an ampere just as a
millimeter is a thousandth of a meter
