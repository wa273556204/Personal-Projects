amplifiers and the regenerative circuit


my dear receiver

there is one way of making an audion even more efficient as a detector
than the method described in the last letter and that is to make it
talk to itself

suppose we arrange a receiving circuit as in fig  it is exactly like
that of fig  of the previous letter except for the fact that the
current in the plate circuit passes through a little coil lt
which is placed near the coil l and so can induce in it an e m
f which will correspond in intensity and wave form to the current in
the plate circuit

if we should take out the grid condenser and its leak this circuit would
be like that of fig  in letter  which we used for a generator of
highfrequency alternating currents you remember how that circuit
operates a small effect in the grid circuit produces a large effect in
the plate circuit because the plate circuit is coupled to the grid
circuit the grid is again affected and so there is a still larger effect
in the plate circuit and so on until the current in the plate circuit
is swinging from zero to its maximum possible value

what happens depends upon how closely the coils l and
lt are coupled that is upon how much the changing current in
one can affect the other if they are turned at right angles to each
other so that there is no possible mutual effect we say there is zero
coupling

start with the coils at right angles to each other and turn lt
so as to bring its windings more and more parallel to those of l
if we want lt to have a large effect on l its windings
should be parallel and also in the same direction just as they were in
fig  of letter  to which we just referred as we approach nearer to
that position the current in lt induces more and more e m f
in coil l for some position of the two coils and the actual
position depends on the tube we are using there will be enough effect
from the plate circuit upon the grid circuit so that there will be
continuous oscillations

illustration fig 

we want to stop just short of this position there will then be no
continuous oscillations but if any changes do take place in the plate
current they will affect the grid and these changes in the grid voltage
will result in still larger changes in the plate current

now suppose that there is coming into the detector circuit of fig  a
radio signal with speech significance the current in the plate circuit
varies accordingly so does the current in coil lt which is in
the plate circuit but this current induces an e m f in coil l
and this adds to the e m f of the incoming signal so as to make a
greater variation in the plate current this goes on as long as there is
an incoming signal because the plate circuit is coupled to the grid
circuit the result is a larger e m f in the grid circuit than the
incoming signal could set up all by itself

you see now why i said the tube talked to itself it repeats to itself
whatever it receives it has a greater strength of signal to detect than
if it didnt repeat of course it detects also just as i told you in
the preceding letter

in adjusting the coupling of the two coils of fig  we stopped short
of allowing the tube circuit to oscillate and to generate a high
frequency if we had gone on increasing the coupling we should have
reached a position where steady oscillations would begin usually this
is marked by a little click in the receiver the reason is that when the
tube oscillates the average current in the plate circuit is not the same
as the steady current which ordinarily flows between filament and plate
there is a sudden change therefore in the average current in the plate
circuit when the tube starts to oscillate you remember that what
affects the receiver is the average current in the plate circuit so the
receiver diaphragm suddenly changes position as the tube starts to
oscillate and a listener hears a little click

the frequency of the alternating current which the tube produces depends
upon the tuned circuit formed by l and c suppose that
this frequency is not the same as that to which the receiving antenna is
tuned what will happen

there will be impressed on the grid of the tube two alternating e m
fs one due to the tubes own oscillations and the other incoming from
the distant transmitting station the two e m f s are both active at
once so that at each instant the e m f of the grid is really the sum
of these two e m fs suppose at some instant both e m
fs are acting to make the grid positive a little later one of them
will be trying to make the grid negative while the other is still trying
to make it positive and later still when the first e m f is ready
again to make the grid positive the second will be trying to make it
negative

its like two men walking along together but with different lengths of
step even if they start together with their left feet they are soon so
completely out of step that one is putting down his right foot while the
other is putting down his left a little later but just for an instant
they are in step again and so it goes they are in step for a moment
and then completely out of step suppose one of them makes ten steps in
the time that the other makes nine in that time they will be once in
step and once completely out of step if one makes ten steps while the
other does eight this will happen twice

the same thing happens in the audion detector circuit when two e m
fs which differ slightly in frequency are simultaneously impressed on
the grid if one e m f passes through ten complete cycles while the
other is making eight cycles then during that time they will twice be
exactly in step that is in phase as we say twice in that time they
will be exactly out of step that is exactly opposite in phase twice
in that time the two e m fs will aid each other in their effects on
the grid and twice they will exactly oppose unless they are equal in
amplitude there will still be a net e m f even when they are exactly
opposed the result of all this is that the average current in the plate
circuit of the detector will alternately increase and decrease twice
during this time

the listener will then hear a note of a frequency equal to the
difference between the frequencies of the two e m fs which are being
simultaneously impressed on the grid of the detector suppose the
incoming signal has a frequency of  cycles a second but that the
detector tube is oscillating in its own circuit at the rate of 
cycles per second then the listener will hear a note of  cycles per
second one thousand times each second the two e m fs will be
exactly in phase and one thousand times each second they will be exactly
opposite in phase the voltage applied to the grid will be a maximum one
thousand times a second and alternately a minimum we can think of it
then as if there were impressed on the grid of the detector a
highfrequency signal which varied in intensity one thousand times a
second this we know will produce a corresponding variation in the
current through the telephone receiver and thus give rise to a musical
note of about two octaves above middle c on the piano

this circuit of fig  will let us detect signals which are not varying
in intensity and consequently this is the method which we use to detect
the telegraph signals which are sent out by such a continuous wave
transmitter as i showed you at the end of letter 

when the key of a cw transmitter is depressed there is set up in the
distant receivingantenna an alternating current this current doesnt
vary in strength it is there as long as the sender has his key down
because however of the effect which i described above there will be an
audible note from the telephone receiver if the detector tube is
oscillating at a frequency within two or three thousand cycles of that
of the transmitting station

this method of receiving continuous wave signals is called the
heterodyne method the name comes from two greek words dyne meaning
force and the other part meaning different we receive by combining
two different electronmovingforces one produced by the distant
sendingstation and the other produced locally at the receiving station
neither by itself will produce any sound except a click when it starts
both together produce a musical sound in the telephone receiver and the
frequency of that note is the difference of the two frequencies

there are a number of words used to describe this circuit with some of
which you should be familiar it is sometimes called a feedback
circuit because part of the output of the audion is fed back into its
input side more generally it is known as the regenerative circuit
because the tube keeps on generating an alternating current the little
coil which is used to feed back into the grid circuit some of the
effects from the plate circuit is sometimes called a tickler coil

it is not necessary to use a grid condenser in a feedback circuit but
it is perhaps the usual method of detecting where the regenerative
circuit is used the whole value of the regenerative circuit so far as
receiving is concerned is in the high efficiency which it permits one
tube can do the work of two

we can get just as loud signals by using another tube instead of making
one do all the work in the regenerative circuit the tube is performing
two jobs at once it is detecting but it is also amplifying by
amplifying we mean making an e m f larger than it is without
changing the shape of its picture that is without changing its wave
form

to show just what we mean by amplifying we must look again at the audion
and see how it acts you know that a change in the grid potential makes
a change in the plate current let us arrange an audion in a circuit
which will tell us a little more of what happens fig  shows the
circuit

this circuit is the same as we used to find the audion characteristic
except that there is a clip for varying the number of batteries in the
plate circuit and a voltmeter for measuring their e m f we start with
the grid at zero potential and the usual number of batteries in the
plate circuit the voltmeter tells us the e m f we read the ammeter
in the plate circuit and note what that current is then we shift the
slider in the grid circuit so as to give the grid a small potential the
current in the plate circuit changes we can now move the clip on the
bbatteries so as to bring the current in this circuit back to its
original value of course if we make the grid positive we move the clip
so as to use fewer cells of the bbattery on the other hand if we make
the grid negative we shall need more e m f in the plate circuit in
either case we shall find that we need to make a very much larger change
in the voltage of the plate circuit than we have made in the voltage of
the grid circuit

illustration fig 

usually we perform the experiment a little differently so as to get more
accurate results we read the voltmeter in the plate circuit and the
ammeter in that circuit then we change the number of batteries which we
are using in the plate circuit that changes the plate current the next
step is to shift the slider in the grid circuit until we have again the
original value of current in the plate circuit suppose that the tube is
ordinarily run with a plate voltage of  volts and we start with that
e m f on the plate suppose that we now make it  volts and then
vary the position of the slider in the grid circuit until the ammeter
reads as it did at the start next we read the voltage impressed on the
grid by reading the voltmeter in the grid circuit suppose it reads 
volts what does that mean

illustration fig 

it means that two volts in the grid circuit have the same effect on the
plate current as ten volts in the plate circuit if we apply a volt to
the grid circuit we get five times as large an effect in the plate
circuit as we would if the volt were applied there we get a greater
effect the effect of more volts by applying our voltage to the grid
we say that the tube acts as an amplifier of voltage because we can
get a larger effect than the number of volts which we apply would
ordinarily entitle us to

now lets take a simple case of the use of an audion as an amplifier
suppose we have a receiving circuit with which we find that the signals
are not easily understood because they are too weak let this be the
receiving circuit of fig  which i am reproducing here as part of fig


we have replaced the telephone receiver by a transformer a
transformer is two coils or windings coupled together an alternating
current in one will give rise to an alternating current in the other
you are already familiar with the idea but this is our first use of the
word usually we call the first coil that is the one through which the
alternating current flows the primary and the second coil in which a
current is induced the secondary

the secondary of this transformer is connected to the grid circuit of
another vacuum tube to the plate circuit of which is connected another
transformer and the telephone receiver the result is a detector and
one stage of amplification

the primary of the first transformer so we shall suppose has in it the
same current as would have been in the telephone this alternating
current induces in the secondary an e m f which has the same
variations as this current this e m f acts on the grid of the second
tube that is on the amplifier because the audion amplifies the e m
f acting on the telephone receiver is larger than it would have been
without the use of this audion and hence there is a greater response on
the part of its diaphragm and a louder sound

in setting up such a circuit as this there are several things to watch
for some of these you will have to rely on the dealer from whom you buy
your supplies and for the others upon yourself but it will take another
letter to tell you of the proper precautions in using an audion as an
amplifier

illustration fig 

in the circuit which i have just described an audion is used to amplify
the current which comes from the detector before it reaches the
telephone receiver sometimes we use an audion to amplify the e m f
of the signal before impressing it upon the grid of the detector fig
 shows a circuit for doing that in the case of fig  we are
amplifying the audiofrequency current in that of fig  it is the
radiofrequency effect which is amplified the feedback or regenerative
circuit of fig  is a onetube circuit for doing the same thing as is
done with two tubes in fig 

footnote  there is always some amplification taking place in an
audion detector but the regenerative circuit amplifies over and over
again until the signal is as large as the tube can detect
