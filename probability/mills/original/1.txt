electricity and matter


my dear son

you are interested in radiotelephony and want me to explain it to you
ill do so in the shortest and easiest way which i can devise the
explanation will be the simplest which i can give and still make it
possible for you to build and operate your own set and to understand the
operation of the large commercial sets to which you will listen

ill write you a series of letters which will contain only what is
important in the radio of today and those ideas which seem necessary if
you are to follow the rapid advances which radio is making some of the
letters you will find to require a second reading and study in the case
of a few you might postpone a second reading until you have finished
those which interest you most ill mark the letters to omit in this
way

all the letters will be written just as i would talk to you for i shall
draw little sketches as i go along one of them will tell you how to
experiment for yourself this will be the most interesting of all you
can find plenty of books to tell you how radio sets operate and what to
do but very few except some for advanced students tell you how to
experiment for yourself not to waste time in your own experiments
however you will need to be quite familiar with the ideas of the other
letters

what is a radio set copper wires tinfoil glass plates sheets of
mica metal and wood where does it get its ability to workthat is
where does the energy come from which runs the set from batteries or
from dynamos that much you know already but what is the real reason
that we can use copper wires metal plates audions crystals and
batteries to send messages and to receive them

the reason is that all these things are made of little specks too tiny
ever to see which we might call specks of electricity there are only
two kinds of specks and we had better give them their right names at
once to save time one kind of speck is called electron and the other
kind proton how do they differ they probably differ in size but we
dont yet know so very much about their sizes they differ in laziness a
great deal one is about  times as lazy as the other that is it
has eighteen hundred and fortyfive times as much inertia as the other
it is harder to get it started but it is just as much harder to get it
to stop after it is once started or to change its direction and go a
different direction the proton has the larger inertia it is the
electron which is the easier to start or stop

how else do they differ they differ in their actions protons dont
like to associate with other protons but take quite keenly to electrons
and electronsthey go with protons but they wont associate with each
other an electron always likes to be close to a proton two is company
when one is an electron and the other a proton but three is a crowd
always

it doesnt make any difference to a proton what electron it is keeping
company with provided only it is an electron and not another proton all
electrons are alike as far as we can tell and so are all protons that
means that all the stuff or matter of our world is made up of two
kinds of building blocks and all the blocks of each kind are just
alike of course you mustnt think of these blocks as like bricks for
we dont know their shapes

then there is another reason why you must not think of them as bricks
and that is because when you build a house out of bricks each brick must
rest on another between an electron and any other electron or between
two protons or between an electron and a proton there is usually a
relatively enormous distance there is enough space so that lots of
other electrons or protons could be fitted in between if only they were
willing to get that close together

sometimes they do get very close together i can tell you how if you
will imagine four small boys playing tag suppose tom and dick dont
like to play with each other and run away from each other if they can
now suppose that bill and sam wont play with each other if they can
help it but that either of them will play with tom or dick whenever
there is a chance now suppose tom and bill see each other they start
running toward each other to get up some sort of a game but sam sees
tom at the same time so he starts running to join him even though bill
is going to be there too meanwhile dick sees bill and sam running along
and since they are his natural playmates he follows them in a minute
they are all together and playing a great game although some of the
boys dont like to play together

whenever there is a group of protons and electrons playing together we
have what we call an atom there are about ninety different games
which electrons and protons can play that is ninety different kinds of
atoms these games differ in the number of electrons and protons who
play and in the way they arrange themselves larger games can be formed
if a number of atoms join together then there is a molecule of
molecules there are as many kinds as there are different substances in
the world it takes a lot of molecules together to form something big
enough to see for even the largest molecule that of starch is much
too small to be seen by itself with the best possible microscope

what sort of a molecule is formed will depend upon how many and what
kinds of atoms group together to play the larger game whenever there is
a big game it doesnt mean that the little atomic groups which enter
into it are all changed around they keep together like a troop of boy
scouts in a grand picnic in which lots of troops are present at any
rate they keep together enough so that we can still call them a group
that is an atom even though they do adapt their game somewhat so as to
fit in with other groupsthat is with other atoms

what will the kind of atom depend upon it will depend upon how many
electrons and protons are grouped together in it to play their little
game how any atom behaves so far as associating with other groups or
atoms will depend upon what sort of a game its own electrons and protons
are playing

now the simplest kind of a game that can be played and the one with the
smallest number of electrons and protons is that played by a single
proton and a single electron i dont know just how it is played but i
should guess that they sort of chase each other around in circles at
any rate i do know that the atom called hydrogen is formed by just one
proton and one electron suppose they were magnified until they were as
large as the moon and the earth then they would be just about as far
apart but the smaller one would be the proton

that hydrogen atom is responsible for lots of interesting things for it
is a great one to join with other atoms we dont often find it by
itself although we can make it change its partners and go from one
molecule to another very easily that is what happens every time you
stain anything with acid a hydrogen atom leaves a molecule of the acid
and then it isnt acid any more what remains isnt a happy group either
for it has lost some of its playfellows the hydrogen goes and joins
with the stuff which gets stained but it doesnt join with the whole
molecule it picks out part of it to associate with and that leaves the
other part to take the place of the hydrogen in the original molecule of
acid from which it came many of the actions which we call chemistry are
merely the result of such changes of atoms from one molecule to another

not only does the hydrogen atom like to associate in a larger game with
other kinds of atoms but it likes to do so with one of its own kind
when it does we have a molecule of hydrogen gas the same gas as is used
in balloons

we havent seemed to get very far yet toward radio but you can see how
we shall when i tell you that next time i shall write of more
complicated games such as are played in the atoms of copper which form
the wires of radio sets and of how these wires can do what we call
carrying an electric current
